            took place at the residence of the bride's father, Mr. Grafton, and a large number of
            invited guests were there to witness the rite and congratulate the handsome couple on
            their prospect for a long life of wedded happiness. The ceremony was performed by Dr.
            J.B. Bittinger, of the FIrst Presbyterian church of Sewickley. The usual joyful
            festivities followed, and with extorted admiration for the splendid display of presents,
            and the demolition of the good things provided, the evening sped away till "train time"
            summoned away the party and the guests from the city, and the suburban neighbors hied
            them home through a sea of mud, to talk over the event of the Sewickley season. Mr.
            Nevin and his bride started on a tour souithward, whither the kind wishes of all their
            friends follow them.</para>
