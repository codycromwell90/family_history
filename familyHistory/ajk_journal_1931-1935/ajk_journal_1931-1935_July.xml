        <para>Diary of Elizabeth Anne Jennings, later Anne Jennings Krush. Known to me and her other
            grandchildren as "Nanny." Her eldest daughter, Carol Krush, inherited all of Nanny's
            journals. Aunt Carol sent the journals to me in February, 2020.</para>
        <para>This journal has an interesting set-up; one page for each day of the year, but with
            lines allowing entries for the same day on four different years.</para>

                                still don't think Mother likes the idea. It hurts so, di, because
                                she doesn't like any of my friends &amp; I don't know what she
                                thinks about Bill. The only thing she likes is that I'm in college.
                                It makes me feel simply lousy &amp; almost awful whenever I think if
                                it, di. But it's no good to change I can't - so help me!!</para>
