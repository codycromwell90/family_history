        <para>Dec. 31, 1928 Anne Jennings</para>
        <para>Diary of Elizabeth Anne Jennings, later Anne Jennings Krush. Known to me and her other
            grandchildren as "Nanny." Her eldest daughter, Carol Krush, inherited all of Nanny's
            journals. Aunt Carol sent the journals to me in February, 2020.</para>
        <para>This journal has an interesting set-up; one page for each day of the year, but with
            lines allowing entries for the same day on four different years.</para>
