        <para>Dec. 31, 1928 Anne Jennings</para>
        <para>Diary of Elizabeth Anne Jennings, later Anne Jennings Krush. Known to me and her other
            grandchildren as "Nanny." Her eldest daughter, Carol Krush, inherited all of Nanny's
            journals. Aunt Carol sent the journals to me in February 2020.</para>
        <para>This journal has an interesting set-up; one page for each day of the year, but with
            lines allowing entries for the same day on four different years.</para>
        <para>Before reading, I highly recommend reviewing Nanny's list of <link linkend="abbrev">abberviations</link> at the end!</para>

                    twelve when I started this - in the seventh grade. I'm a Junior now. When I end
                    my next one, I'll have graduated from college, I hope! Time flies, but I've had
                    fun keeping you even if I did sometimes get 3 weeks behind. The lock to this is
                    all flooky now, but I can still make it work. I hereby resolve for 1931 to try
                    not to swear &amp; to keep my new diary more faithfully.</para>
