            <d:para>Have had this for a few years now; got half way through and now I’ve decided to
                give up. Mr. Gardiner is a noted conductor of Bach’s choral works and I own a couple
                of albums that he has conducted. But in spite of his enthusiasm, he does not
                overcome the fundamental problem of writing about another art form. For each
                cantata, he writes much more than you get from the liner notes, but does not provide
                enough to allow you to follow along as you listen to the cantata. It would have been
                much better if he had done a series of lectures on a smaller selection of cantatas.
                As a biographer of Bach, he provides a great deal of insight on how he composed his
                works, but shows little understanding of the culture / world view in which Bach
                operated. Mr. Gardiner is very much a man of the modern secular world and projects
                his values onto Bach more than truly trying to understand Bach. My recommendation -
                buy Mr. Gardiner’s albums, but skip this book.</d:para>

            <d:para>The subtitle, which sums up this book nicely, is: 'The Diary of a Gulag Prison
                Guard 1935-1936. As you might expect, this is not an uplifting book. Mr. Chistyakov
                was drafted into a position as a junior officer supervision prison guards building
                railroads in the Soviet Far East. A native of Moscow, Mr. Chistyakov was less than
                thrilled with his new surroundings, and most of his diary is spent complaining about
                his lot, thinking of ways to get out of his position and complaining about his
                superiors. If the prisoners were at the very bottom rung of Gulag society, the
                guards were barely one step above them (indeed, many guards were former prisoners.)
                And depending on their skills and work tasking, sometimes the prisoners had some
                leverage over their guards. While Mr. Chistyakov remained a loyal Soviet, he was
                very critical of the Gulag. Mr. Chistyakov's diary ends before we learn of his fate;
                apparently he was arrested himself at some point. All that is known is that he was
                killed at the front in 1941 fighting the Germans.</d:para>

            <d:para>Thomas gave this book to me for Christmas; he attended a lecture my Mr. Ross at
                Tufts University and bought the book afterwards. These days, the phrase "Peace in
                the Middle East" is synonymous with "a hopeless task." Nobody has tilted at this
                windmill harder than Mr. Ross, and I say that not in disparagement but to illustrate
                the depth of his background in this subject. In summary, the authors believe that
                the only hope for peace is for the creation of separate states and that given the
                continued bad faith and judgement of Palestinian leadership, the only way for this
                to occur is for Israel to impose the boundaries themselves. But before presenting
                his recommendations, they examine the careers of four Israeli prime ministers
                (Ben-Gurion, Begin, Rabin, and Sharon. Each of these prime ministers had to make a
                decision that balanced Israel's need for security while advancing the possibility of
                achieving peace - most famously by Begin and Sadat at Camp David. This book is well
                written, well reasoned and gives honest attention to viewpoints that differ from the
                authors'. </d:para>

                unexpected; I won't spoil it here because it is so fun to see how the novel unfolds.
                Written in the form of journal entries, which works surprisingly well. In a sense,

            <d:para>Revised edition. I started this several years ago, and finally got around to
                finishing it. Central premise is to explore the difference between investment and
                speculation and to offer guidance to those who wish to invest intelligently rather
                than simply gamble with their money. Asks the reader to evaluate their interest in
                the process of understanding investments and to assess their goals. If nothing else,
                this helped me to recognize that I am curious about how money can be put to
                effective use, but my level of interest does not rise above simple curiosity. Which,
                I suppose, is why I am a software engineer and not a financial analyst.</d:para>

            </d:simplelist>
            <d:para>A well written and well balanced biography. President McKinley, was a man of
                even temperament, quiet confidence and low key charisma. He had the bad luck not
                only of being assassinated but of being followed in office by the hyper-energetic
                and highly charismatic Teddy Roosevelt. Despite being overlooked for many years, he
                may rank as one of the most effective presidents in terms of using his executive
                powers in coordination with his party's operations in the legislature. I find it
                interesting that Mr. Merry, who also wrote A Country of Vast Designs about President
                Polk, has chosen to write about two presidents who are relatively unknown despite a
                tremendous amount of success in office. Both served during periods of tremendous
                expansion of American power (and geography) and both seem to be ethereally regarded
                as accidental by-standers to these monumental events. But Mr. Merry make a
                compelling case that they actually were shaping events through a quiet brand of
                leadership in coordination with effective behind-the-scenes political operations.
                Mr. Merry does not seem to advance any particular ideology in these two biographies.
                He balances praise with criticism and presents his subjects' point of view as well
                as those of their respective opponents. In particular, I was struck by two
                observations by Mr. Merry. Pres.. Polk was an opponent of tariffs, and one of his
                first actions was to pass legislation to greatly reduce them. The apparent result
                was a great increase in government revenue - despite lower taxes, economic expansion
                produce greater government revenue. So great, that the US paid the costs of military
                action in the Mexican War without incurring debt. Pres. McKinley was a great
                believer in tariffs, and one of his earliest actions was to raise tariffs. The
                apparent result was a great increase in government revenue, this time due to higher
                taxes and increasing economic activity. So great an increase as to finance the
                Spanish-American War (as well as the subsequent fighting against insurgents in the
                Philippines) with the addition of a short-term tax on beer and other consumer items.
                Mr. Merry does not make this comparison - indeed he seems little interested in
                economic details - but it shows that he does not appear to apply modern political
                outlooks to his historical analysis. For a present day Republican would be greatly
                in favor of the Democratic Polk's policy of lowering taxes while a present day
                Democrat would much prefer the Republican McKinley's approach of raising
                taxes.</d:para>

            <d:para>A very interesting novel. Solovyov is a graduate student in history whose thesis
                is on General Larionov. On one level, the novel seems to be a very satirical take on
                Russian academia. Even given the difficulties of translation (for instance, in
                Russian, the novel apparently included hundreds of footnotes, but the translator
                opted to include them in the text), the novel is amusing. Then there are the details
                of Solovyov's upbringing in a remote railway town and his romantic interests. These
                descriptions begin with the same sense of ironic detachment, but gradually these
                topics take on greater depth. And finally, there is the life of General Larionov,
                who commanded the White army's last stand against the Bolsheviks in the Crimea, yet
                who somehow escaped execution and died a natural death of old age in the Soviet
                Union. Whenever Solovyov's research turns up new details on the general, the story
                jumps back in time. The general remains a rather two dimensional character in the
                novel and much of his concern seems to be trying to understand the boundary between
                life and death and to understand his relationships with those who have died before
                him and those who still live. The novel concludes in a rather dramatic fashion in
                which a number of seemingly innocuous details described earlier in the novel are
                linked in the General's confrontation with the Bolshevik forces as they occupy
                Yalta. I plan to read this novel again someday, if for no other reason than to see
                how many more details tie to the conclusion. But also, Mr. Vodolazkin seems to be
                attempting a larger examination on the process of recording and understanding
                history versus living and understanding life in the first place.</d:para>

            <d:para>Audio Book, I checked this out before driving up to Boston to pick Thomas up
                from Tufts University due to the school closure as a result of the coronovirus
                outbreak. The autobiography of Chris Kyle, a Nay SEAL who completed 4 combat tours
                in Iraq. He served as a sniper and is credited with more confirmed kills than any
                sniper in American history. Mr. Kyle seemed to be one of those individuals who are
                drawn to the experience of combat. Not in the somewhat theatrical style of say,
                General Patton, but in the manner of someone who takes pride in doing a very
                difficult job and doing it very well. Mr. Kyle was not of a philosophical or
                intellectual inclination, and his story is told with great enthusiasm. What I think
                is the best touch with this book was the fact that they included, in the first
                person, the perspective of his wife as she dealt with the challenges of being
                married to a SEAL in a time of war. In a sad bit of irony (not dealt with in this
                book), Mr. Kyle was murdered by a fellow veteran a number of years after the war.

            <d:para>I've been slowly working on this for a few years now. It is amusing that this is
                entitled as an "Introduction" as this is written at a far higher level than that
                which most people would consider introductory. I believe that it is intended as an
                introduction for graduate level students of philosophy and theology and probably
                professors in these fields who do not have a Christian background. The structure is
                straight forward, but the writing is often dense. So, I plowed through some sections
                with glazed eyes, yet found other sections to be very engaging and thought
                provoking. Fortunately, the concluding paragraph give a very clear summary of the

                that there is a meaning he is quite incapable of destroying. Is he therefore to sit

                thing as meaning, he can and must cheerfully and intrepidly do the work of history,
                even though from his little segment of it he will have the feeling that it is a
                labor of Sisyphus and that the stone of human destiny is rolled anew, generation
                after generation, up the hill only to roll down again once more and nullify all
                previous efforts. Whoever believes knows that things move “ forward ”, not in a
                circle. Whoever believes knows that history is not like Penelope’s tapestry, which
                was always being woven anew only to be undone again. Even the Christian may be
                assailed by the nightmares, induced by the fear of fruitlessness, out of which the
                pre - Christian world created these moving images of the anxiety that all human
                activity is vain. But his nightmare is pierced by the saving, transforming voice of
                reality: “ Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world ” ( Jn 16: 33 ). The new
                world, with the description of which, in the image of the final Jerusalem, the Bible
                ends, is no Utopia but certainty, which we advance to meet in faith. A salvation of
                the world does exist — that is the confidence that supports the Christian and that
                still makes it rewarding even today to be a Christian"</d:para>

            <d:para>Finished this on Easter Day, 2020, in the year of the coronovirus pandemic. I
                can't remember where I first heard about this book; certainly almost no-one today
                would think that Mark Twain would have written a favorable portrayal of Joan of Arc.
                When I was young, I had read A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which
                displayed Twain's biting satire, confidence in modern progress in comparison to
                medieval ignorance and superstition. So I turned to the internet to get the reaction
                of others to this book. Susan Harris, a professor states: "By the time Twain is
                writing <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="italic"
                    >Recollections</emphasis>, he’s not a believer. He is anti-Catholic, and he
                doesn’t like the French. So he writes a book about a French-Catholic-martyr?
                Ostensibly, it doesn’t make a lot of sense." Most modern opinions cited on
                Wikipedia, unless they are from profession Catholics, either share this befuddlement
                or our downright dismissive. Yet this is what Mark Twain had to say: "I like
                    <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="italic">Joan of
                    Arc</emphasis> best of all my books; and it is the best; I know it perfectly
                well. And besides, it furnished me seven times the pleasure afforded me by any of
                the others; twelve years of preparation, and two years of writing. The others needed
                no preparation and got none." A newspaper review (cited by his daughter) at the time
                of publication sums up this work with: "His language has undergone a startling
                change. Not flippancy, but pathos, meets us on every page; the sardonic mocking
                spirit has been conquered by the fair Maid of Orleans, and where aforetime we met
                laughter, we now meet tears." Personally, I loved this book. There are some
                drawbacks. The ongoing interactions between Noel and the Paladin is annoying and
                distracting - I times I would skip over sections relating between the two. But as a
                reflection on the life of Joan and her impact upon French history, this is a
                masterful work of historical fiction.</d:para>

            <d:para>When it comes to book titles, usually I complain about inane sub-titles. In this
                case, the sub-title actually tells you the theme of the book. Silly me for thinking
                this would be a naval history. The actual H.M.S. Dreadnaught does not make its first
                appearance until page 461, and then the ship gets a whole chapter describing its
                construction and technical innovations. And, since the name of the ship is used to
                describe all of the battleships built by Britain from 1904 until WWI, there are
                additional mentions of "dreadnaughts" in the remaining 447 pages of the book. And
                there is a second volume - Castles of Steel - to follow. But I digress. Mr. Massie
                provides a detailed examination of the political, economic and military relations
                between Germany and Great Britain between the unification of Germany until the
                outbreak of WWI. Since Britain was historically antagonistic with France, and
                periodically with Russia, it was by no means inevitable that Britain would have
                sided with France and Russia in the decade before WWI. An implied thesis for why
                this was so is Kaiser Wilhelm II's insistence on building a powerful fleet. In the
                end, I can't help but think that Germany and Great Britain, as the two most powerful
                nations in Europe, badly played their hands. Bismark's sole policy following the
                unification of Germany was to prevent a combination of more than two powers (the
                powers of his time being Britain, France, Austria and Russia) uniting against
                Germany. Wilhelm II's blind adherence to an alliance with Austria alienated Russia.
                His insistence on a powerful navy alienated Great Britain. Great Britain, under Lord
                Salisbury, was content to avoid involvement in continental squabbles while
                maintaining superiority at sea. The Liberal cabinet that came to power in 1906
                managed to improve ties with France, in part to prevent further friction from
                competing colonial endeavors. This certainly served Great Britain's interests. But
                the involvement of the British Army staff in coordinating potential operations was
                naive. The French, weaker than Germany, had every interest in drawing Britain into
                an alliance. Britain, aside from assuring a hostile power did not appear in Belgium
                and the Netherlands, had no inherent interest in supporting the French army against
                the Germans. In the end, the weak powers dragged the strong into global
                conflict.</d:para>

            <d:para>Anna read this last summer as part of her summer reading for English. It details
                the total breakdown of social order caused by a pandemic of sudden blindness. In the
                part of the book set when the characters are forced into quarantine, the story is
                like a very condensed version of the Gulag Archipelago. Aside from the narrative of
                social chaos, the interactions of the characters allow Mr. Saramago to reflect on
                physical blindness vs. moral blindness. Perhaps the most interesting feature of this
                story is that it is filled with colloquialisms. The most annoying feature of this
                novel is the rendering of dialog. Extended dialog tends to run in single paragraphs
                with no delineation of the speaker and often no punctuation between

            <d:para>David Bentley Hart once published a long list of books that he recommended and

                journey to Italy in the mid 1930's is fairly interesting. Despite the fine writing,
                I really did not like any of the characters. Nor did I relate to their emotional
                turmoil In a way it reminds me of Death in Venice. Both books struck me as having an
                overblown, morbid fixation on death. Not death as it relates to the human condition,
                but with an individual's fixation on their own death. Mr. Szerb might argue, as does
                one of his characters, that modern civilization has distracted us to such a degree

            <d:para>An examination of two "intelligence failures - the failure to predict the
                Iranian Revolution in 1979 and the mistaken belief that Iraq had weapons of mass
                destruction prior to the second Gulf War. Mr. Jervis does have a number of
                recommendations for improving the process of analysis of intelligence; in particular
                by adopting more rigorous methodologies from social science and academia. (To which
                the cynic will reply - but of course he would recommend that because that is his
                background!) But Mr. Jervis is a very thoughtful and balanced critic. He does not
                argue that the Intelligence Community (IC) should be able to predict the future. And
                in the case of Iraqi WMD, he argues that based on what they know, the IC wasn't out
                of line to predict that Iraq had them - indeed the Intel agencies of all the
                countries involved and the media all believed the same thing at the time. His
                criticism is that the IC should have noted that the actual degree of uncertainty
                with its intel and should have considered ways in which it could have challenged its
                assumptions. Mr. Jervis also points out the intelligence is not policy, and those
                who make policy don't always want better intelligence. Elected officials (and even
                bureaucrats) tend to have pre-conceived notions of what they want based upon their
                political leanings / world view, and better intelligence that runs counter to their
                belief will not be welcome. Indeed, he suggests that policy makers like using the
                IC's mistakes so that politicians can use the IC as a scapegoat. Stylistically, this
                is a dry and academic treatment of the subject, but Mr. Jervis offers a model of
                clear, rational evaluation of evidence. He takes examples of failures from each
                administration from Roosevelt thru George W. Bush (except for maybe Truman) and from
                other nations as well. Nor does he adopt polemical language to make his points. And
                there is the occasional humor: "We are not happy with the apocryphal story of a
                British Foreign Office official who proudly said on his retirement that throughout
                his career he had said there would be no European war and was wrong only
                twice"!</d:para>

            <d:para>A fairly balanced history of Greece since its independence from the Ottomans.
                The idea that Greece needs a biography instead of a history is somewhat of a conceit
                of the author; based upon his history, if Greece were a person, it would be a person
                suffering from manic-depression or split personality. I in no way intend this as a
                criticism of Greece or the Greeks, but to poke fun at the author's pretensions. But
                Mr. Beaton does a commendable job of detailing the challenges that the Greeks have
                had in creating an independent, stable, prosperous country. He describes the long
                standing tensions between tradition and modernity, between east and west, between
                religious and ethic identity, between democracy and dictatorship. A useful study
                that probably shed some light on what much of the Balkans have in store as they deal

                the history of the war at sea in WWI. Which, as far as battleships go, pretty comes
                down to the Battle of Jutland. I am already familiar with that battle, and Mr.
                Massie does a fine job of describing the action and evaluating the performance of
                the participating admirals and ships (as he does with all the engagements in this
                book.) He gives a great deal of Adm. Jellico, who is usually criticised for
                excessive criticism. But his handling of the British Grand Fleet ensured a
                devastating blockade of Germany, and his tactics at Jutland ensured the German High
                Seas Fleet would not win. Mr. Massie also gives a lot of attention to Churchill's
                performance running the Admiralty, the Gallipoli campaign and the evolution of
                German submarine warfare. A few observations about naval warfare in WWI. Just like
                with the armies on land, technology had evolved to allow the projection of
                tremendous fire power over very long distances. Strategically, communication
                technology allowed the fleet to stay in close contact and coordination with
                headquarters. But tactically, the newness of wireless communication combined with no
                technology to improve navigation considering the high speeds of modern ships meant
                that both the British and the Germans often missed out on great success (the Germans
                at the Battle of the Falklands and the British at Jutland). And, one can't help but
                conclude that the world lost its collective mind in August 1914. The stunning amount
                of casualties inflicted in pursuit of such paltry goals. Also, interesting to
                reflect on the naval competition between Britain and Germany in light of the current
                tensions between the U.S. and China.</d:para>

            <d:para>Pevear &amp; Volokhonsky translation, which is highly commended online. This
                book had an insert indicating that it was an Oprah Winfrey book club recommendation
                - kudos to Oprah for this recommendation, although I wonder how many people bought
                the book only to discover this edition is 817 pages long! This book has sat in my
                collection for some time now as I had developed somewhat of a negative view of
                Tolstoy. Not exactly sure why, but some of the short stories of his had struck me as
                overly moralistic and perhaps self-righteous. But I was deeply impressed with this
                novel. First of all, the plot summary that I was familiar with was that this was the
                story the "fall" of a high society women who leaves her husband. While that is
                technically true, and while Anna Karennina's emotional struggle is the main driver
                of the story, you could make the argument that she is not the main character in this
                novel. I would argue that Konstantin Levin is actually the main character, and that
                the novel might more accurately been titled "Love and Marriage" (cue the Frank
                Sinatra song …) Tolstoy offers in depth examination of love, marriage and faith and
                the various ways these played out in upper crust Russian society in the 1870's. The
                novel is brilliantly written and I truly enjoyed it. I didn't rank it as a 5 because
                I doubt I'd read the whole thing again, although I might return to the final
                section.</d:para>

            <d:para>I inherited this book from Grandpa Rodine. Since there is no cover jacket, I
                assumed it was a history of the "War of Jenkins' Ear" (more generally referred to as
                the War of Austrian Succession." Instead, this is a work of historical fiction, set
                at the start of the Seven Years War with characters relating their experience in the
                War of Jenkins Ear. The stories are very well done. The plot device that drives the
                telling of the stories is far less interesting (and far too wordy.) The authors
                clearly enjoyed the process of getting "inside" their characters. But in the end,
                the plot is not convincing, the dialog is too wordy and whole effect falls
                short.</d:para>

            <d:para>Inherited from the library of my grandfather - Thaddeus Krush. Originally
                published in 1938, the style is dated. For instance, when referring to the American
                people, he often says "we," where today historians would strive to view their
                subject with an outsiders perspective. And in 2020, could you imagine anyone writing
                the following sentence: "General Jackson was an ideal slave-owner." p349 - and
                surviving the Twitter storm that would follow? But for all the stylistic challenges,
                the book is well researched and won a Pulitzer Prize. Mr. James provides ample
                footnotes and includes frequent quotations from letters and speeches of Jackson, his
                friends and his foes.</d:para>
            <d:para>Mr. Marquis portrays Jackson as the paragon of the Scots-Irish "Border
                Chieftain". Proud and honest to a fault, devoted to his family and friends and
                implacable to his foes. His central political tenet was the preservation of the
                United States and service to the common people (as Jackson understood the needs of
                the people.) Mr. James view Jackson mostly as a conservative"The contest of 1824 …
                witnessed the opening of the schisms that were to wreck the Republican Party and
                remould it, Andrew Jackson's violent moderation superseding the mild radicalism of
                Thomas Jefferson …"p364. "The gradual alteration from border conservative to
                national liberal is noteworthy …" p721 , but one whose views adjusted to his
                perception of what was best for the union. </d:para>
            <d:para>I would probably rate Jackson as the most interesting person in the first half
                of the 1800's, and this book does a good job of capturing the drive and energy of
                one who never sought popularity yet became the most popular American of his era. And
                Mr. James does a very good job of balancing this with the details of his personal
                life. Mr. James clearly views slavery as a great wrong and he notes the hypocrisy in
                the southern attempts to soften the image of slavery by referring to it as the
                "peculiar institution" and to the slaves as "servants." But he does not belabor the
                details of Jackson's brief venture as a slave trader, and he treats Jackson's
                benevolent handling of his slaves as a positive indication of the quality of
                Jackson's character. The chattering classes of today, in their correct (but
                self-righteous) condemnation of the bitter fruit that slavery has born in our
                country, would brand him a simple bigot and consign him to oblivion. The same holds
                true for Mr. James' handling of Jackson's relations with Native Americans. Indeed,
                perhaps the greatest shortcoming of this book is the complete ignoring of the Trail
                of Tears. </d:para>
            <d:para>Two weeks ago, a mob attempted to pull down the statue of Jackson in front of
                the White House. In part, this is what makes Jackson so interesting. He did not
                create the society in which he lived and he was not one to question the pros and
                cons of the social order that he inherited. For that, he deserves no credit and
                clearly falls short of the standard of a "great" man. Yet, if Jackson had joined
                Burr in a successful attempt to create an independent nation along the Mississippi,
                or not defeated the British at New Orleans and prevented them from returning
                Louisiana to Spain or not held the Union together during the South Carolina
                nullification crisis, doesn't it seem probable that slavery would have endured much
                longer in a long running civil war between different sections of are now the U.S.?
                And his personal popularity was key in pulling the process of selecting Presidential
                candidate from the hands of state Congressional delegations and thus to bolstered
                American democratic traditions. And as determined a military foe of the Native
                American as Jackson was, during the campaign against the Creeks, he adopted an
                orphaned Creek boy when no Creek woman would do so and raised him as his own child.

            <d:para>Thomas read this for a history course this summer; I read it given the current
                COVID-19 pandemic. First off, let's dispense with the review of Ms. Spinney's
                writing style. The book's sub-title with its hackneyed "how it changed the world"
                sets a bad first impression. Given the scope the subject, Ms. Spinney is upfront
                about organizing her book more as a collection of narratives rather that a strict
                chronological layout. I am fine with that approach, but there are times when the
                structure of her paragraphs simply do not make sense. For instance, there is one
                paragraph that begins with a sentence describing the impact of the "Spanish Flu" on
                pregnant women. The next sentence states that many people bled from the nose and
                mouth and the rest of the sentence deals with the experience of soldiers on troop
                transports. There is a section in one chapter that focuses on the flu in Chile that
                concludes with a single paragraph on the Shanshi province in China. Then the chapter
                breaks to a new section examining the flu in Shanshi. Why the orphan paragraph in
                the previous section? She is prone to run-on sentence and sentences in which two
                clauses don't really belong together. She sometimes uses words out of context -
                Chilean Lieutenant Dagoberto Godoy is an "ace pilot" because he flew a plane over
                the Andes (his Wikipedia bio indicates that he never served in time of war, and thus
                never shot down the requisite 5 enemy planes to be classified as an "ace".) And
                there is the sentence in which she states that "By 1918 [Poland] had been entirely
                erase from the map..." The Polish partition was complete in 1795- certainly "by
                1918" but her syntax would imply the partition had only been recently completed. I
                hold the editor and the fact-checkers from her publish (Public Affairs, New York)
                most responsible for allowing so many annoying little errors.</d:para>
            <d:para>Issues of stye aside, Ms. Spinney's coverage of the scientific efforts to
                understand that the flu is top notch. Her coverage of the public policy actions
                taken to try to manage impact of the pandemic are also well done. It is clear from
                her writing that she is not a fan of "traditional" societies, institutions and
                social structures, but she is fair in pointing out where the "traditionalists"
                played a helpful role. And while he sympathies clearly lie with the "scientific"
                mindset, she is honest about the short comings of those who try to practice the
                "scientific method" as well. What I found most interesting in her account is how
                slowly "human nature" changes and indeed how slowly scientific knowledge advances.
                In 1918-19, it was not known that the flu was caused by a virus (or even that such a
                thing a virus existed). Those socialites that best weathered the flu were those that
                practiced the time-honored practices of social distancing and quarantine. Today, we
                know much more about the virus that causes COVID-19, but we still have a very
                limited knowledge of the exact mechanics of how it spreads. Yet the most effective
                response still seems to be social distancing and quarantine of those deemed to be at
                high-risk. But in 1918 as in 2020, the interactions between politicians, bureaucrats
                and scientist seems to have improved very little.</d:para>

            <d:para>Stacy's brother Tim gave Thomas Rick Atkinson's three volume history of the US

            <d:para>Bought this for Anna recently as she has been a fan of Steph Curry and the
                Golden State Warriors. This is not a well written book. It is rambling,
                dis-organized and offers very little insight on what made the Warriors so good.
                Mostly it is a rehashing of Kevin Durant's tenure with the Warriors and Mr. Strauss'
                long running feud with Mr. Durant. Mr. Strauss portrays Mr. Durant as an insecure
                super-star, yet Mr. Strauss comes across as equally insecure. Indeed, Mr. Strauss
                inserts himself into the book far too often. If the book were intended to portray
                life as a reporter covering a great team, that would have been fine. Another
                instance where good editorial guidance could have greatly improved the book. Mr.
                Strauss presents some interesting views, but it in the end it is not a compelling
                treatment of its subject.</d:para>

            <d:para>A relatively brief treatment of one of the seven deadly sins; written as part of
                a collection covering all seven. Each chapter is, in effect, an essay on an aspect
                of envy. And, as usual, Mr. Epstein brings his tremendous learning to bear upon the
                subject and writes with style, charm and wit. I laughed out loud about five or six
                times while reading this book. For instance, he writes a chapter dealing with the
                envy the old hold for youth - he titled the chapter: "The Young, God Damn Them." Or
                this example of understated irony: "The rich want to be beautiful or wish themselves
                wise; and the wise, if they really are wise, know that the wisdom begins with the
                acknowledgement that one knows nothing, so, really, what the hell good is that."
                Looking at these two examples, I realize that they do not do Mr. Epstein justice.
                The chapter title, removed from the context of the book, make him seem like an angry
                crank. And the quote could imply that he has no respect for wisdom. </d:para>

            <d:para>Reminded me a bit of "Crime and Punishment", where the author portrays the inner
                struggle of a young man who has committed murder. But while the structure of the
                novels are similar, the "outlook" of the novels differ greatly. Mr. Wright is just
                as effective as Dostoevsky in taking the reader inside the head of one consumed by
                the commission of murder and attempts to avoid capture in the aftermath.
                Unfortunately, once the story moves into the court house, Native Son devolves into a
                series of long speeches about the deplorable social conditions faced by African
                Americans. These ruminations are worth reading, but would have been better as an
                essay. The end effect is similar to Sinclair's "The Jungle," where a gripping story
                devolves into a political tract. Mr. Wright was a member of the Communist Party for
                a while, and this seems apparent in the final section of the novel. But, not knowing
                much of his biography, and just inferring from what I read in "Native Son", his
                Communism is unrecognisable when contrasted to that of the Bolsheviks. It seems most
                concerned with support for organized labor and for racial equality. And while
                American communism never achieved lasting influence and International communism has
                ignominiously crumbled, in hindsight it must be said that on the issue of racial
                equality the American communists were correct. It is a shame that the loathing the
                average American bore the communists probably served to discredit racial equality
                once it was espoused by the communists. Yet in this instance, the communists deserve
                some credit, while the Democratic Party bears the shame of enabling "Jim Crow" and
                the Republican Party (in the 20th century) that of generally ignoring the issue
                altogether. Issues of artistic style aside, this remains a compelling
                novel.</d:para>

            <d:para>I bought this book for Thomas due to his great interest in his high school World
                History course. Mr. Frankopan rightly notes the traditional historical emphasis on
                the rise and triumph of the West. This book puts the spotlight on the history and
                influence (religious, cultural and economic) of south and central Asia. Until his
                coverage reaches the 20th century, I felt he was reasonably balanced and did a great
                job of covering event that are unfamiliar to most in the West. For all his
                enthusiasm for his subject, there are some flaws in his outlook. Mr. Frankopan seems
                to feel that in order to boost the profile of the Silk Road region, he must
                denigrate the West. For instance, if the Mongols destroyed certain cities to
                intimidate those they will encounter later, he notes that for their historical
                reputation for savagery, they were pragmatically asserting their authority over the
                regions they were conquering (and, in total, preserving the great wealth they were
                ruling). He does not give the Crusaders, or the British or the Americans any such
                benefit of the doubt. Indeed, if America had followed the conventions of the
                Mongols, we would have dropped nuclear bombs on Baghdad, Tehran and Kabul in the
                aftermath of 9/11. And he states: "The great iron, then, that although Europe
                experienced a glorious Golden age, … it was forged by violence." True, but how does
                that differ from the Persian Empire, or Alexander and the Hellenic empire, or the
                Roman Empire, or the Byzantines, or the Islamic caliphates, or the Mongol and
                Ottoman Empires - each of which established it hegemony over central Asia by
                force?</d:para>
            <d:para>This leads us to the 20th and 21st Centuries, which receive as much coverage as
                all of the ages past. He criticizes the European powers from asserting their
                economic and political interests. By implication, this is a bad thing, even though,
                based on the evidence presented in his history, they were no worse than those who
                proceeded them. In the end, he is product of post-WWII western education that
                believes in human rights, the rule of law, democracy and intellectual development,
                as practiced in the West. When the West fails to live up to his ideals, he is quick
                to criticize. And that would be a fine approach to take, if you also held the
                Soviets, the Chinese and the Indians to the same standard. He accurately notes the
                wide ranging attempts by the Soviets to reshape the region to its own purposes, yet
                this is done without censure. And he treats American involvement in the Middle East
                as tragic. Certainly, it has been so for the Middle East. But unlike the British,
                the US (to date) has bankrupted itself in defense of a colonial empire. The US has
                failed to remake the Middle East in the image idealized by the West, yet the US has
                enough population and natural resource on its own to fall as far as the British did
                in the 20th Century. Mr. Frankopan believes the center of the world sits in Central
                Asia, which makes him largely blind to North and South America and Africa (even
                Egypt generally gets short shrift.) </d:para>
            <d:para>There are a couple of minor nitpicks I have with regards to his coverage of the
                Crusades. He criticized the eventual focus of the Crusades on the capture of Egypt
                due to a simply desire for plunder and wealth. That is certainly partially true, but
                from a strategic point of view, whoever controls Egypt controls Jerusalem. It is no
                accident that Salahdin, who captured Jerusalem from the Crusade state had first
                established his rule over Egypt. (And note, that even today, the US provides
                enormous amounts of aid to Egypt in order to preserve peace between Egypt and
                Israel.)</d:para>
            <d:para>Aside from my substantial criticisms, this is still a worthwhile book. Mr.
                Frankopan writes well, and in his enthusiasm does remind us that there is much to
                learn from outside our own culture.</d:para>

                For instance, Aristotle’s prime concern in this book is how to live to achieve
                happiness. In modern usage, happiness is a feeling - think of the yellow smiley face
                figure. But for Aristotle, happiness is not a feeling, but the achievement of the
                highest possible goodness. Good is another word that differs greatly from

            <d:para>An interesting overview of the attempt by some scientist to assert a scientific
                theory of morality. In some sense this is understandable given the endless conflict
                and controversy that continue in spite of the best efforts of philosophers and
                theologians to develop a universal standard of morality. But the authors point out
                that over 200 years of scientific efforts have done no better. Worse, some
                scientists, in order to make their hypothesises fit their facts, seem to have
                concluded that there is no such thing as morality at all. The authors are not at all
                anti-scientific, and certainly aren't in the least pro-religion. Rather, they are
                two left-of-center academicians who recognize that an attempt to explain away
                morality allows anyone to justify their actions, good or bad.</d:para>

            <d:para>An electronic book from Amazon.com. The formatting was absolute trash. Instead
                of electronic text, the book consisted of electronic images of scanned pages. The
                images didn't even fit 100% within the viewer, and the type was painfully small. And
                I suspect that there are some pages missing. Despite this, The Republic may be
                Plato's most famous work. It is written as a dialogue between Socrates and his
                friends, and begins with some of his colleagues asserting that the unjust are
                happier than the just. The rest of the book is an examination of justice, happiness
                and the nature of the city state that would promote justice. It is best to think of
                this as a "thought experiment" rather than a handbook for a political platform.
                Because many of his ideas, taken simply at face value, sound more like the republic
                of Florence under Savoronella, or the Bolshevik Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
                Indeed, Plato's (or Socrates, I'm not sure if these are truly Socrates' views)
                suggestions point to the modern obsession of developing the right social structure
                to ensure human flourishing. But if, instead, you read it a framework for
                questioning human learning and behavior in the pursuit of betterment, it is still
                useful even if some of the prescriptions have been dis-proven by later history. All
                in all, I prefer Aristotle's "lecture" style of writing and his emphasis on
                achieving the "mean" between an excess and a dearth of a virtue to Plato's dialogues
                and emphasis on the eternal forms. Too many times, Socrates' companions are little
                more than straw-men, or worse, sycophants who simply agree with everything he
                proposes.</d:para>

            <d:para>An extended poem describing the tenets of Epicureanism. Key points are that all
                matter is ultimately composed of tiny objects (he tends to call germs, but what we
                would call atoms) and empty spaces; that this matter is eternal and of infinite
                number, that everything composed of these basic building blocks is not eternal, that
                everything is explained by the interaction of these objects and the forces which
                cause them to move. Epicurus said that there were gods, but that they were not
                involved in the natural order; Lucretius seems more inclined to the view that gods
                don't exist. (Although he does dedicate the poem to Venus - the may simply be a
                manner of style.) The reading is tough sledding; perhaps his Latin poetry was
                eloquent. This translation certainly is not although it does seem dated. As a work
                of science, like most "scientific" works from the classical era, it contains many
                errors of interpretation of how nature works. But as a work of history of scientific
                thought, it is a useful illustration of how the ancients reasoned. If their
                conclusions were often wrong, the process of observation and rational argument
                clearly anticipate modern scientific methods.</d:para>

                overview on the wide range of concepts evaluated and explained by Aristotle. The
                style of this book is somewhat dry and pedantic, like a text book, but not bad. Its
                great strength is in the clear explanation of what Aristotle taught and how it
                applies even today. </d:para>

            <d:para>Dr. Hart presents an argument for the existence of God by refuting atheist
                attempts to limit all knowledge to that which can be physically verified in the
                framework of the scientific method. More importantly, he reformulates the common
                arguments for the existence of God as traditionally espoused by the world's great
                religions (as well as the Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle.) In
                summary, the very fact that the universe exists (which science cannot explain
                because it can only deal in the realm of what already exists) is the primary
                argument. Science can deal with an endless chain of causes and effects, but there
                must be an "uncreated" and "unchanging" being outside of any cause and effect for
                anything to exist at all. The fact that we all have and recognize consciousness is
                his next proof; he argues against any attempts to explain consciousness as a result
                of any purely material cause. Incidentally, he includes a very strong critique on
                the idea of "artificial intelligence" and the analogy of the brain (and
                intelligence) as some sort of advanced "computer" algorithm. Finally, the sense of
                bliss, for instance in human kind's pursuit of the good, the true and the beautiful.
                "God is thus experienced as that bliss in which our natures have their consummation
                because that bliss is already, in God, the perfect consummation of divine unity of
                being and consciousness: infinite being knows itself in infinite consciousness and
                therefore infinitely rejoices." This is not a work for the casual reader. True to
                his style, there are many long sentences and arcane words. But his arguments are
                clear, thorough and easy to follow.</d:para>

            <d:para>This book came from Stacy's father's collection; her brother Tom recommended
                that I read it. The reason I hadn't planned on reading this book, indeed the reason
                I have taken so long to actually getting around to reading it is that I had
                developed a prejudice against the book in my time as a Midshipman. The book was
                published in 1987, when I was a Plebe. This was during the very heart of the Reagan
                era defense build up of conventional military forces to contest the Soviets. The
                Reagan era also saw many heated debates between those who contended that America was
                on the decline due to Vietnam and economic competition with Japan and those who
                argued for the expansion of American military power and an aggressive policy to
                counter Soviet influence. Needless to say, the more popular view at the Naval
                Academy was in support of an active, "muscular" American involvement in world
                affairs. When Mr. Kennedy's book was published, I remember that it was lauded by
                those were on the other side of the argument. As I was young, and didn't enjoy the
                idea that the United States could be a declining power, I was inherently disposed to
                avoid the book. A further prejudice against the book was a result of Mr. Kennedy's
                very bad luck to have published it just two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall
                and the collapse of the Soviet military threat. He joined the very long list of
                experts who failed to foresee this prospect.</d:para>
            <d:para>Having finally read his book, this serves as a very useful reminder to question
                your prejudices. The central premise of the book is to examine the how various
                nations rose to great power in the periods from 1500 - 1987 and then fell from
                power. It gives very great weight to the economic component of power, and if it has
                a central argument, it is that it is very expensive to maintain military forces
                strong enough to project power, and it is even more expensive to maintain a strong
                military presence far from a nation's border. Mr. Kennedy does not discount the role
                that diplomatic and military skill and technical innovation play in creating a
                powerful nation. He simply asks the obvious question of how a nations economy can
                support its ambitions. For instance, in discussing Germany during World War I, he
                offers an explanation for the food shortages in Germany that I have not encountered
                before. The most common explanation was that the British naval blockade was so
                effective. But given the large landmass of Germany and the Austria-Hungarian empire,
                this never seemed to be a convincing argument. Much more convincing is Mr. Kennedy's
                argument that the sheer number of men pulled into the military (and the armament
                factories) resulted in a critical shortage of manpower left to support agriculture. </d:para>
            <d:para>There is nothing anti-American (or anti- any particular nation) in his
                arguments, and he made no predictions that Japan, or the Soviets, or the Chinese
                would inevitably supplant the US as a global power. Indeed, he is very balanced in
                evaluating the relative strengths and weaknesses of the large powers at the end of
                the 20th century. He clearly recognized the great strain the Cold War had placed
                upon the Soviet economy, but like nearly everyone else, he had no idea how quickly
                the Soviet Union would collapse. Rather than arguing that Japan would surpass the
                US, he anticipates many of the problems that would hinder Japan since the 1990's.
                And he noted the rise of the Chinese economy since the death of Mao, and gave some
                thought to the impact of sustained growth yet did not anticipate just how far China
                would advance. And he did not foresee (but who did?) the economic revolution of
                computer technology. But his central examination of the relationship of economic
                development (and decline) with political, diplomatic and military power seems to me
                to be quite sound.</d:para>

            <d:para>The second of Mr. Atkinson's three-volume history of the U.S. Army in Europe in
                WWII. This volume covers the invasion of Sicily and the Italian campaign through the
                capture of Rome on June 5, 1944. As always, Mr. Atkinson delivers a compelling
                narrative. He does an excellent job weaving first hand accounts into the flow of
                events. He follows some individuals throughout the course of the campaign, and
                weaves in other individual voices to highlight particular events. He does not offer
                bold judgements of those in command, but he does evaluate controversies from all
                sides; noting the generally accepted verdicts while presenting the case of those
                being judged. In this volume, General Patton's slapping of two hospitalized soldiers
                and General Mark Clark's attacks along the Rapido River and the break out from Anzio
                are clearly the subjects that have received the most criticism over the years. Mr.
                Atkinson presents all the available facts, the reactions of those who participated
                in the events, the reactions of other officers and later historians and an
                occasional pointed comment of his own. But in the end, he leaves the reader to their
                own judgement.</d:para>

            <d:para>Highly recommended by Joseph Epstein. A common sense evaluation of how to write
                with good style. Certainly a highly subjective goal, but Mr. Lucas' suggestions seem
                to me to be on the right track. In summary: be honest, be concise, end sentences
                with strong words and paragraphs with strong sentences, pay attention to metre and
                don't be afraid of "poetic" devices such as simile and metaphor. In style, this book
                comes across as a lecture by a professor of long tenure. It is dated in the sense
                that many of his examples are in French or Greek. Perhaps, as a result of frequent
                trips to the endnotes for the translations, this makes his chapters seem longer than
                they need to be. If Mr. Epstein was a student of Mr. Lucas in developing his own
                style, then I would say that the student has surpassed the master.</d:para>

            <d:para>Anna is reading this in her English class. When I was ordering the electronic
                version of the book from Amazon, I was amused by one review in which the reader was
                disappointed that there was very little romance in the letters, but a great deal of
                instruction on how to run a monastery! The modern idea of a love letter is based on
                the Greek version of love Eros. While Peter and Heloise do acknowledge their
                "erotic" love, the letters are really more centered on the Greek version of love
                Agape. These are letters between two very intelligent and highly educated people, so
                the letters read generally read more like academic treatises than personal letters.
                But they do offer a very personal insight into life in medieval life and philosophy.

            <d:para>Capt. Junger's memoirs of his service in the German army in WWI. He survived
                four years of combat in the trenches and was wounded 7 times. Here is his account of
                the battlefield: "The Modern battlefield is like a huge, resting piece of machinery.
                Countless hidden eyes, ears, and arms are idly watching for some poor soul to arrive
                alone at any minute. Then as a fiery overture, a single red flare rises high above
                from some hole in the earth. A thousand guns roar at the same time. At a stroke, the
                work of annihilation begins, driven by countless levers and its crushing gears.
                Battlefield commands increase like sparks and flashes through a tight electrical
                network. This initiates and spurs on increased destruction. From the rear areas, a
                steady stream of new people and material are set in motion, and thrown into the
                surge of annihilation. Everyone feels compelled to reach the focal point of the
                deadly new events. It is as if a whirlpool seizes them from afar, and a mysterious
                will yanks them in with a relentless precision."</d:para>
            <d:para>One interesting note about Junger. After serving in combat for four years and
                winning the highest medals awarded by the German army, he never rose above the rank
                of Captain nor served in a higher capacity than that of company commander.
                Tocqueville, in Democracy in America, expresses the opinion that in war, democracies
                are at a disadvantage a the start of the war but have the advantage in an extended
                conflict (book 2, chapter 24). He suggests this is the case because in a democracy,
                military service is generally undesirable and those who are ambitious take their
                talents to other fields. In contrast, in an aristocracy, the officer class comes
                from the nobility and tends to attract the best of that class. Junger was not from
                the aristocracy and enlisted at the start of the war. The German army was quick to
                promote promising enlisted men to the rank of 2nd Lieutenant, which is what happened
                with Junger after his first stint in the trenches in 1914. From that point forward,
                he was promoted twice in a period of about 4 years. In the modern American army, all
                junior officers can expect to be promoted with the exact same rapidity. Yet he was
                one of the finest soldiers in the German army with extensive experience in combat.
                He does note quite frequently that officers of longer tenure (and often with noble
                titles) were promoted ahead of him. So perhaps Tocqueville's suggestion has some
                merit, at least in this case. </d:para>

                academics still turn more than a century later, you may be so lucky as Tocqueville
                and be rewarded with an introduction by Joseph Epstein. Mr. Epstein begins his
                introduction with this: "The older one gets, the more it becomes clear that it is a
                great mistake not to have been brilliant when very young. Difficult to arrange, I
                realize, but what a splendid saving of time it is to come into one's intelligence
                early!" This is a long work, undertaken by the author not so much to study the
                United States as to understand the impact of the dying of European aristocracy and
                the rise of individual freedom, political liberty and democratic government. He
                travelled in the United States and offers brilliant insight in to the strengths and
                weaknesses of the young nation. And he offers commentary on what he thinks this
                means for the future of democratic government. I found myself highlighting far more
                passages than I can include here for future consideration. But as a warning, I found
                that this book is best taken in short, regular doses. His writing focuses on the
                abstractions he forms from the experiences of his study and his travels. His style
                is direct and he has the gift of creating a very vivid abstraction. Equally often,
                too much abstraction without supporting detail makes it hard to hold interest.

                so it took a while to get through his longer poems, such as "Song of Hiawatha." Long
                though this poem was, it was still an interesting retelling of Native American
                folklore. "Evangeline" was another long poem, but I did not care for it's soap opera

            <d:para>The third and final volume of his "Liberation Trilogy" covering the American
                Army in Europe from D-Day until the German surrender. Fine writing, as usual. Two
                nits to pick with this volume, both very minor. First, I'm not sure why he devoted
                so much coverage to the Yalta Conference, most of the other conferences of the
                allies were passed over more succinctly. Second, he does not mention that when
                Roosevelt died in Warm Springs, Georgia, he was in the company of his mistress, not
                his wife. Normally, I would commend him for bypassing salacious details not germane
                to his story. But he had not afforded the same courtesy with regards to speculation
                or gossip about Eisenhower and Patton. Aside for those minor point, he is very
                balanced in his assessments of the performance of the American and British generals
                (and the French and Germans, too.) Alas, General Simpson, the commander of the US
                Ninth Army gets very little attention, although he has one of the best quotes:
                "Never send an infantryman where you can send an artillery shell." Most people will
                not care about this, but my father's father served in the 102nd Division in the 9th
                Army. The 102nd Division gets a brief mention in the book for it's discovery of a
                German massacre of prisoners at Gardelegen; this is something my grandfather would
                have witnessed personally because he was an Army doctor.</d:para>

            <d:para>Inherited this from Nanny, it is inscribed 'Thaddeus P Krush 5/63.' Although I'm
                not sure my grandfather actually read the book because the binding was very tight
                and the book did not feel "broken in." Thomas was assigned this book his freshman
                year at Tufts. This is a thought-provoking, but uneven book; it is a series of
                lectures given by Mr. Carr. The first chapter is best, but they get progressively
                weaker. On the positive side, he commends historians to have an "imaginative
                understanding for the minds of the people with whom he is dealing, for the thought
                behind their acts." He notes that history is not just the assembly of all possible
                facts on a subject, but involves which facts are relevant. He is suspicious of
                historians making moral judgements on their subject. On a more problematic note, he
                argues that history be treated as a "science" along the lines of the "social
                sciences." He correctly notes that the social sciences differ from the physical
                sciences in that they cannot separate the "observer" from the "observed." But his
                disdain for providing definitions as being "pedantic" leads him into trouble. He
                doesn't clearly delineate what he means by "science", rather using analogy to other
                branches of learning that in modern usage are known as sciences (e.g. physics,
                botany). Like those who utilize the modern "scientific method," he attempts to limit
                philosophy, theology and morality from the evaluation of historical evidence. This
                would be fine, except that he then takes on the subject of "progress" in history. He
                notes the problems with what is known as the "Whig" interpretation of history in
                which things are always getting better. He notes that this was a self-serving
                viewpoint for historians of the British empire at the peak of its power.
                Never-the-less, he argues that the "progress" of history has been for the best
                because it was the result of interactions that lead us to where we are today - it is
                best because it is. In his chapter on causation, this is really where he runs into
                problems with his refusal to clearly define terms. His idea of causation, in
                Aristotelian terms, is merely of the "efficient" causes - every event is the result
                of a constant interplay of cause and effect. His belief in "progress" is now
                problematic, because that is a value judgement implying "final" causes. He correctly
                notes that the Judeo-Christian world view of man's progress towards perfection in
                God is the source of this view of history. He throws out the theological and
                philosophical basis for this view - the "final" cause and maintains a belief that
                "efficient" causes have an inherent direction. And he seems to really mus-understand
                the idea of "chance", or "accident" in his preferred usage. He seems to mean
                "chance" to be an occurrence that has no cause - more on line of the term "miracle."
                But, to take an example from my field of software engineering. The computer operates
                at the level of 1's and 0's - known as bits. Sometime bits flip unintentionally and
                change data. There is always a cause for this flip (electro-magnetic interference)
                but when it happens and how it affects the data is for all practical purposes
                unforeseeable. His final chapter, where he tries to provide some rough
                generalizations on what the future hold, is the weakest. As a side note, he had one
                very interesting comment on the Russian Revolution. He asserts that the Bolsheviks
                were very conscious of how the French Revolution played out and were worried about a
                "Napoleon" taking power. When Lenin died, mos Bolsheviks viewed Trotsky as the
                likely candidate as the Soviet Napoleon given his military role in the civil war.
                And thus, they over-looked Stalin.</d:para>

            <d:para>A beautifully written fictionalized account of childhood during the summer of

            <d:para>We inherited this from Stacy's father. The book is inscribed: "July 4th, 1993.
                George: I don't think I shall ever forget this 'neck of the woods' either. Allen L.
                Pope." Mr. Pope is mentioned in a footnote in the book and he was a prisoner in
                Indonesia when the Kalaris' lived there (I'm pretty sure there is an article in our
                files describing his release.) I started reading this book about 10 or 12 years ago
                knowing that Stacy's father worked in Laos in the early 1960's. The book is very
                interesting, but I paused my reading as the events approached the U.S. withdrawal
                from south east Asia in the early 1970's. I knew things did not work out well for
                the Hmong and that the "rest of the story" was going to be sad. Having finished the
                book at last, I can attest that indeed the Hmong were abandoned to a terrible fate.
                I can only imagine that Stacy's father found this to be a difficult book to read
                given his personal connection to the events in question. I must commend Ms.
                Hamilton-Merrit for the sheer volume of first-hand research that went into this
                book.</d:para>

            <d:para>Anna's college English professor, who is actually a history professor, assigned
                readings from this book. This is a collection of primary accounts of the bubonic
                plague epidemic in Europe in the late 1340's. It wasn't on his original course
                syllabus, but he threw it in given its relevance to our own COVID epidemic. Like any
                collection of primary accounts, the reader suffers from the lack of narrative flow.
                Even so, this was a fascinating book. As much as human knowledge has advanced in 700
                years, we have still been taken by surprise with COVID and we still struggle to
                understand the causes, effects and long term impact. If many in the 1300's would
                ascribe the plague to the will of God, they were still aware that there were
                physical causes and thus hope for a treatment. Today, we have a much better
                understanding of how diseases spread, yet many ascribe political causes to the
                spread COVID and there is still much we don't know about how COVID spreads and why
                some are affected more than others.</d:para>

            <d:para>Not many people today remember Erasmus, who was one of the most learned men of
                his day. I'm sure that many (non-Lutherans) today would not even remember Martin
                Luther unless they dimly recollect from a wold history course that he was one of the
                prime movers of the Protestant Reformation. Early in their careers, both were
                greatly concerned with corrupt practices in the Church. When he finally split from
                the Church, Luther hoped that Erasmus would follow. But Erasmus did not, and in his
                letter "On the Freedom of the Will", he stated that his primary objection to
                Luther's views was that Luther rejected human "free will." Erasmus defined free will
                as "a power of the human will by which a man can apply himself to the things which
                lead to eternal salvation, or turn away from them." And in making his case that
                humans indeed possess free will, he recognized that Luther would only accept
                evidence from the Bible. So he limits his arguments, although he does point out
                Luther's inconsistency in rejecting arguments by the "Church Fathers" because they
                are only men and thus sinners, yet his followers accept Luther's authority on how to
                interpret scripture. In style, Erasmus is humble and gentle, yet very logical. In
                response, Luther is quite bombastic and critical. He rejects Erasmus' definition of
                free will, yet does not provide a clear definition himself. Luther flatly rejects
                the possibility that humans have free will, and asserts that if they do any good, it
                is because God has given them the "gift' or grace to do so. Because Erasmus'
                arguments do not address his own definition of free will, he rejects them and does
                not bother to offer much evidence. If this were a formal debate, such as on in which
                a high school debate team participates, Erasmus wins hands down. If we use Erasmus'
                definition of free will, the fact that Luther thinks it is necessary to try to
                convince Erasmus of his point of view proves that he and Erasmus have some measure
                of personal choice in the matter. This is the closest statement from Luther that I
                could find that explains his definition of free will: "The supreme concern of free
                will is to exercise itself in moral righteousness, or the works of that law by which
                its blindness and impotency derive their assistance." This tells us not what free
                will is, but what it does. I think Luther is confusing God's "final" causes with the
                "formal" and "efficient" causes that dominate our day to day life. Luther seems to
                think that God, in having a final end in mind, must therefore control all of the
                efficient causes that in the end will reach that final goal. But in the court of
                public opinion in the 1500's, Luther's much more emotional approach to the question
                clearly had a major impact. In today's age, Erasmus' arguments would carry the day
                in the halls of academia, but Luther's would carry the day out on the political
                campaign trail. My ultimate critique of Luther, based solely on this exchange, is
                that he was too caught up in his own ego. Pascal had a brilliant insight when he
                noted that the "heart has reasons that reason knows not." In his letter, Erasmus
                attempts to align the "love" of the heart with a rational evaluation of evidence.
                Luther is all heart; accepting that God loves man, he rejects nearly all rational
                thought as "sophistry." Personally, I find Erasmus much more convincing.</d:para>

            <d:para>I think we inherited this book from Stacy's father. It is the first volume of a
                three-volume biography of Winston Churchill. Mr. Manchester writes very well, this
                is as engrossing as American Caesar. He presents Churchill in all his glory and in
                all his short-comings. Mr. Manchester clearly regards him as the greatest Englishman
                of the 20th Century, but his biography does not fall into simple hagiography.
                Churchill is convincingly portrayed as the single most insightful strategist in
                either the Allied or Central Power camp, yet he is something of a Cassandra as he is
                unable to convince others of his views. He takes the blame for the debacle at the
                Dardanelles, yet it was Kitchener and Gen. Ian Hamilton who botched the job. He
                enacted a number of benefits aimed at the working class and the poor, yet he earned
                the undying enmity of organized labor by refusing to be bullied by strikers. His
                energy was unmatched in government, yet he was periodically afflicted with
                depression. In all, Mr. Manchester is commendably balanced. When he covers a subject
                that has aroused controversy, such as the Dardanelles campaign, he gives Churchill's
                views as well as the views of others who criticized Churchill. And just like Robert
                Massie in Castles of Steel, he make a compelling argument Churchill was 100% correct
                in proposing the operation and that the reason it failed was solely due to Army
                incompetence. For instance, Kitchener waffled for months before committing troops,
                Hamilton chose to land at the tip of the peninsula instead of its base (as suggested
                by the Navy) and compounded his mistake with an unorganized and dilatory landing
                operation that allowed the Turks to seize the high ground overlooking the landing
                zones. Nor does Mr. Manchester shy from the portrayal of the upper-class (in the
                English sense of class, not the American) ignorance/indifference/prejudice against
                the lower classes and colonial people. Mr. Manchester does not excuse this, but he
                does place his views in the context of Churchill's upbringing and the society in
                which he lived. And, when Churchill's views evolved, he portrays that as well. I
                found only two small short-comings with the book. First, Mr. Manchester very briefly
                delves into Churchill's "psychology," including an outdated examination that links
                Churchill's "body type" with his personality. But to his credit, he moves past this
                very quickly and in no way attempts to play the role of Churchill's "therapist." The
                second shortcoming is that he goes perhaps a bit too far in giving a portrayal of
                Victorian and Edwardian society in England. Interesting, but doesn't always add much
                to the story.</d:para>

            <d:para>Christmas gift from Stacy. Apparently Mr. Cameron is a reporter for the
                Annapolis Capital-Gazette. This explains the good and bad of this book. The book is
                a history of Navy football focusing on the years between 1950 and the present (book
                was published in 2017). He interviewed many of the featured players and coaches; his
                quotes from these interviews are the highlight of this book. His style is spare but
                sometimes he is confusing by trying to be too brief. The book ends up feeling like a
                collection of newspaper articles without much narrative flow. There are occasional
                odd paragraph breaks. And his editor earns a failing grade as there are a number of
                words / names that are miss-spelled.</d:para>

            <d:para>Translated by Donald Cress. This could actually count as two book, I suppose.
                The Discourse on Method describes Decartes' approach for approaching the development
                of knowledge. In a way, it a precursor of the modern scientific method. Meditations
                on Philosophy is more a development of why a human's ability to think is the
                'essence' of their existence as a person, why the mind is distinct from the body and
                how this knowledge confirms the existence of God. His famous phrase: "I think
                therefore I am" appears in the Discourse, but is fully developed in the Meditations.
                Personally, I think he is more influenced by Plato and his concept of "ideal forms",
                but I think he takes this too far in his distinguishing a person's mind and body. I
                also think that he would be shocked at the lengths to which some later philosophers
                and scientists have taken this insight. </d:para>

                interests. I have finished more books this year than in any single year since I have
                started keeping a record of what I read. There are a few reasons for this. First,
                Thomas and Anna are both in college now, so I have much more free time that is not
                devoted to their activities. Second, the COVID pandemic has prevented any travel,
                and greatly reduced the frequency of social interaction outside of the home. And
                finally, my government agency's decision to split the workforce into two teams and
                have only one team come in to the office on any given week has also provided more
                free time. In a way, this makes it harder for a book to stand out as the best. In
                another way, since I used my extra time to read a number of books that have been
                gathering dust on our bookshelves, there were a lot more mediocre books. </d:para>
            <d:para>So, after due consideration, Envy will take the blue ribbon. Mr. Epstein

                reading his review, I considered purchasing Mr. Lucas' book for Thomas and Anna to

                print out Mr. Epstein's review and place it inside a copy of Envy for both Thomas
                and Anna. Mr. Epstein, the student, has far surpassed his master, Mr. Lucas. Second

            <d:para>On the cover of this book is written in ink: "Med. Det. 405th. Do not remove

                accounts of German army actions in Poland, France, Yugoslavia, and Greece intended
                to familiarize Army officers with what to expect when fighting the Germans. Since it
                was published early in the war (1942) the source of its information came from German
                publication supplemented by accounts in the European press. Thus, the details are
                lacking in certainty. Stylistically, it is rather dry, as one would expect from Army

            <d:para>This was a long, painful book to read. Much of this is due to style; in essence,
                this is a text book on political science in the language and style of the
                mid-1600's. When reading Shakespeare, the effort required to stick with sometimes
                obscure text is worthwhile because otherwise the poetic language would be lost in
                translating it to current English. This book, which seeks to make an intellectual
                argument, would be greatly improved by a "translation" to current usage.
                Difficulties with style aside, this book remains famous for Hobbes' argument for the
                basis of government in a "social contract" of the people. Hobbes argues that this is
                due to man's fear of death and the chaos of the state of nature in which every
                person pursues their own benefit. The positive insight of his social contract is the
                idea that government is ultimately derived from the people. In a more current
                reformulation, that "government exists for the people, not the people for the
                government." The downside to his social contract theory is his assertion that once a
                people has a given form of government, then they are duty bound to maintain that
                government no matter what. Moving past the social contract theory, he spends a great
                deal of time on the role of Christianity in government. He notes that there is a
                difference between civil law and Church law, but notes that while Church law is
                universal in scope, it can only be enforced by civil authority. And since civil
                authority derives from the people of the commonwealth, it is up to the ruler of the
                commonwealth to enforce, not the Church. But this involves the reader in the
                arguments of the Protestants against the Catholics. In fact, he spends a great deal
                of ink refuting a work by St. Robert Bellarmine. He also take a dim view of the
                ancient Greek philosophers. He thinks that the Greeks corrupted Jewish and Christian
                faith with the idea of demons and spirits and that they argue endlessly about
                universal forms and essences. While Hobbes uses the Bible for texts to back his
                arguments, his point of view is that human nature can be explained without recourse
                to the idea of the "highest good." Personally, I think his antipathy to Aristotle in
                particular is due to his favor with the Catholic Scholastics. For his style of
                argument could be said to follow closely to Aristotle - he takes great care in
                defining his terms, stating his arguments and supporting them with examples from
                history and the Scriptures. Yet it must be said that he falls short of Aristotle and
                Aquinas in that he is generally content to dismiss those with whom he disagrees
                rather than to honestly engage with them. Then again, that would have made this a
                much longer book! One final personal observation - I personally like the use of the
                term "common-wealth" to refer to a government as it emphasizes the goal of the
                common good. </d:para>

            <d:para>Actually two separate works in a single volume. These two books are French
                Enlightenment critiques of morality, religion and science. As an expression of a
                materialist philosophy of nature, these offer little improvement on Lucretius' On
                the Nature of Things. The science is more up-to-date (but still primitive by current
                standards) and yet the argument against the existence of God because we have a
                better understanding of how the physical laws of nature work is still not
                convincing. And while providing a witty critique of the mores of late ancient-regime
                French culture, it does not offer an alternative that can replace Judeo-Christian
                morality or Greek / Roman ethics. </d:para>

            <d:para>I do not understand why anyone would see that this book is fit for publishing,
                nor to assign for reading. If this were the only work by which to judge him, I
                believe that he would have long since been forgotten. These reflections were written
                late in his life, and in all honesty, they seem to be the reflections of someone
                suffering from self-delusion and even paranoia. One reflection has an interesting
                discussion on truth, another on his interest in botany. And throughout, he seems to
                hold a sort of proto-romantic view of the benefits of being close to nature and the
                problems with society and commercial interests. But I would say that close to 90% of
                this work relates to his struggle with his persecutions, which seem to have existed
                largely in his own imagination.</d:para>

            <d:para>Inherited from Nanny; the book is stamped with "Green Bird Circulating Library,
                Sewickley, Pa." This is a really strange book - published in 1939, it is a story of
                a "body double" for Adolf Hitler. Hitler winds up being poisoned in 1938 and his
                body double is installed as Hitler. The plot is outlandish, but the point of the
                book seems to be a presentation of the inner workings of the Nazi party. Couldn't

            <d:para>A Christmas present from Stacy and the kids. Another volume in the Landmark
                series of classical history. Xenophon was a student of Socrates, a contemporary of
                Plato and a soldier who commanded the "10,000" Greek mercenaries in a retreat from
                modern day Iraq to the shores of the Black Sea in present day Turkey. This work
                picks up where Thucydides left off in the Peloponnesian War, and continues thru the
                period when Thebes ended Sparta's days as a great military power. On one hand, it is
                easy to see how the Greek city states wore themselves out in two generations of
                ceaseless warfare and set the stage for their conquest by Philip of Macedon. On the
                other hand, they gained two generations worth of military expertise which Alexander
                was able to turn loose upon the Persian Empire. His stye is easier to read than
                Thucydides, but his pro-Spartan sympathies shade his accounts. And true to the
                Landmark tradition, this book is a treasure trove of maps, footnotes and appendices
                to allow the modern reader to make sense of the details.</d:para>

            <d:para>Francis Bacon concluded that philosophy of Aristotle in particular, and the
                Greeks in general, based as they are upon the principles of logic and deduction,
                were no longer of use for advancing human knowledge. So, in this work, he outlines
                an approach for using inductive reasoning in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. He
                recognized that the risk of using an inductive approach would be to get lost in an
                endless accumulation of facts, so he proposed a framework for guiding induction.
                This work is clearly a milestone in the development of the scientific method, but it
                is not without its flaws. With the passage of time, it turns out that deduction is
                still useful, even in science. And, after stating his purpose, it is rather
                difficult to follow the framework he proposes for developing induction as he
                proposes a long list of "aphorisms" to guide the quest for knowledge. And he is not
                particularly good about defining his terms - in fact, he seems somewhat hostile to
                the idea of spending much time in "philology." So I recommend the first two sections
                of this book, but skip the rest.</d:para>

                the sale of this short work; although I must say that I am proud to have found a
                version that was free ;) They do have a strong critique of the impact of the
                industrial revolution on the lives of the working class. But their "10 point plan"
                for resolving the problem has been pretty convincingly proven wrong by the Soviet
                Union and even "Communist" China. I think their problem is that they think too much
                in generalizations and offer no insight into individual responses to individual
                conditions. And even from the very beginning, the fathers of communism show a talent
                for labelling different versions of socialism that need to be rooted out along with
                the industrialists and capitalists. Considering that I graduated from college in the

            <d:para>Stylistically, this book is somewhat of a mess. There is an overall structure
                that is clear, but each individual section often feels like ideas are just thrown
                together. In reading the afterwards, Dr. Ivereigh states that the book started with
                a period of questions and answers and then he developed some themes as pointed out
                by Pope Francis. I think a strictly Q&amp;A format would have been more effective.
                The book is not universal in scoped; the target audience seems to be only the
                developed Western countries. The Pope, as the head of the universal Church, clearly
                articulates the final causes to which our response to the COVID-19 pandemic should
                aim. His suggestions as to the means to the final end are simplistic (dare I say
                naive) and contradictory. Pope Francis possess great charm and charisma, but in this
                book his concern for the souls of the believers and the well being of the
                marginalized are diminished by concrete suggestions of dubious value.</d:para>

            <d:para>In the matter of style, Mr. Mill is too verbose. But that is largely due to the
                stylistic difference between the mid-1800's and today. "On Liberty" is an exposition
                of what today we would call "Classical Liberalism," and some of its tenets seem
                amenable to modern day Libertarians. "Utilitarianism" is a defense of the idea that
                moral goodness shroud be determined by the "greatest happiness" principal where what
                is good is that which produces happiness for the greatest number of people. His idea
                of happiness seems to drift from that of Socrates/Plato/Aristotle, but not so far as
                the modern conception of happiness with "feeling good" or self-esteem. Personally, I
                found "Considerations on Representative Government" to be the most thought
                provoking. Finally, his calls for equal rights for women in "The Subjugation of
                Women" have largely been vindicated. Although, I must add that he address only in
                passing the danger to a women that they bear the cost in time, money and emotional
                energy for the raising of children. Mr. Mill does not seem to consider the
                possibility that women will be abandoned by their husbands (or, in the modern case
                by their romantic partners) and left to raise the children alone.</d:para>

            <d:para>Two books in one volume. My first encounter with Nietzsche was in college in my
                Western Culture class where we were assigned selections from his Birth of Tragedy. I
                found his writing to dense and hard to read, and I never bothered to read the entire
                book. These two books have the advantage of being much easier to read. Instead of
                long academic discussions, he seems to have come to favor collections of short
                fragments. But he gave up any attempts at reason or logic and issues a steady stream
                of invective and ad hominem attacks in place of arguments. So, in illustration,
                let's turn the tables on Prof. Nietzsche. "He is obsessed with sickness and
                associates this with Western morality in general and Christianity in particular. The
                psychologist will say that the loss of his father at an early age made him angry at
                God, the ultimate father figure. He tried to be the obedient son and pursued
                theological studies, but when he contracted syphilis in a visit to a brothel, he
                found the guilt too much to bear. Instead of reforming himself, he turned on
                Christianity as the cause of his guilt and remorse. His horror at his own sickness
                lead him to label Christianity as a religion of sickness. His insignificance and
                lack of success after a promising start to his academic career made him envious and
                obsessed with a will to power, a power he would never possess himself. His acid pen
                was a cry for attention from those he envied but would never pay him heed." If I
                were to carry this exercise on for 100 pages and throw in frequent proclamations of
                how smart I am for being the first to ever think such bold thoughts, then you will
                have a sense of his style. </d:para>

            <d:para>Freud's argument that religion is an illusion based upon human "wish"
                fulfillment. He also argues that scientific knowledge makes religion obsolete and
                that it will soon pass away. This is ironic, for he provides no actual evidence for
                his assertions. Freud was a genius in the development of psychoanalysis to treat
                mental illness, but many of his ideas have not stood the test of time. This book, in
                which he moves into areas not amenable to the scientific method, can only convert
                those whose inclination is already to un-belief. Freud says that those who do not
                agree are clinging to an illusion. Those who believe know that in this subject,
                Freud is the delusional one making claims in the name of science that science cannot

            <d:para>Having read Nicomachean Ethics last year, for Lent this year I picked out two
                books exploring the Christian concept of happiness. Archbishop Sheen lays out the
                Christian view that happiness lies in discovering and living with the transcendent
                love of God. This book is written for the "popular" audience, and so he relies much
                more on argument by analogy than on theological arguments from reason. Not bad, but
                better suited to young adults or those new to Catholicism.</d:para>

            <d:para>Picked this up for Lenten reading following this year's theme of "eudaimonia" or
                "happiness." This is not a classic in the literary sense, but the book does bear
                another reading. It is part textbook, part self-help guide and part personal
                testimony. Where Cardinal Sheen's book on the same topic can be likened to a
                pre-game speech by a coach to a team, this is more like a plan for running the
                team's whole season from pre-season workouts, through practices and onto game
                strategy. There are three more volumes that build upon this book. The question is,

            <d:para>A collection of essays rather than an actual book on the topic. In general, the
                essayists focus on a particular general, generally in light of an experience in
                which their performance was criticized or found wanting. One of the six was a junior
                officer in the Army early in his career, but the point of view of all the articles
                is more that of an academic. For instance, the first essay is on Joseph Johnson and
                his relationship with Jefferson Davis. The author high lights the various ways in
                which Johnson was an ineffective general and he ascribes most of this to his
                personal insecurity and hostility to superiors. Certainly true points. But he covers
                only briefly the military aspects of his poor performance. He mentions his penchant
                for strategic withdrawals to preserve the fighting strength of his armies and notes
                his consistent failure to actually reconnoitre and plan his withdrawals ahead of
                time. This resulted in many instances where he was forced to destroy scarce
                resources that could have been saved with planning. In noting these failures, the
                essay then examines his hesitancy to take responsibility for actions that might harm
                his reputation, but does not examine his relationships with his subordinates or the
                composition or capabilities of his staff. </d:para>

            <d:para>The title is obviously a nod to Douglas Southall Freeman's "Lee's Lieutenants,"
                and the topic is in many ways similar to Bruce Catton's trilogy of books on the Army
                of the Potomac, with more of a focus on the high command than on the common soldier.
                I have not yet read Mr. Freeman's work, but Mr. Sears is nearly as good a narrative
                writer as Mr. Catton. As a study of the Union high command, Mr. Sears chose to
                re-tell the history of the Army of the Potomac and to include relevant discussions
                on the key generals throughout. This is in contrast to Thomas Buell's approach in
                "The Warrior Generals" where he chose 3 pairs of generals to compare and contrast.
                Mr. Sears is more in tune with the political nature of the job of a Union general
                (particularly in the Army nearest to Washington, DC) than is Mr. Buell. But he
                somewhat shares Mr. Catton's view that the generals should have been left to be
                generals, and the politicians left to be politicians. But I think this view is
                somewhat misplaced. Setting aside von Clauswitz's statement that war is an extension
                of politics, a civil war by its very nature involves a political failure on a grand
                scale that no citizen - general or politician or private soldier or private citizen
                - can avoid becoming entangled. By 1864, Grant, Sherman and Lincoln best understood
                this; far more so than Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, George Meade or George
                Thomas. The "old regulars" of the Army of the Potomac, epitomized by George
                McClellan but also included Meade and John Gibbon never seemed to grasp that the
                capture of Richmond would be largely inconsequential in the final outcome of the
                war. So I can't give this book great credit for originality or for an in depth
                insight into understanding how the high command of the Army of the Potomac was
                ultimately able to prevail over the Army of Northern Virginia. But I can recommend
                it as a well-researched and well-written treatment of its subject. What I would
                really like to see would be a work, following the mold of Plato's Republic,
                structured around an imaginary conversation between Grant and Lee in which they
                explore the topic of what it takes to be an ideal general.</d:para>

            <d:para>The second volume of a planned 3 volume history of Joseph Stalin. This volume
                begins with Stalin having consolidated his control of the Communist party, (and thus
                the Soviet Union) and ends on the literal eve of the German invasion of Russia. It
                covers such momentous periods as the forced collectivization of farms (and the
                corresponding mass starvation), the Great Terror and the opening stages of World War
                II. Mr. Kotkin's style is to open a chapter focusing on a particular period by first
                setting the stage, then providing a large number of short scenes covering events,
                and then end with a summary tying the events to the larger picture. His stated focus
                is to study how Stalin acquired, maintained and utilized "power" and this informs
                what is covered. For instance, while the mass starvation in the Ukraine and
                Kazakhstan was a horrific episode in Russian history, it gets relatively short shift
                in this book after Mr. Kotkin examines why and how Stalin came to his decision to
                force collectivization. In contrast, his relationship/competition with Hitler gets a
                much more nuanced and thorough treatment. Indeed, in a way this volume is a joint
                biography of Stalin and Hitler. One interesting perspective Mr. Kotkin brings to
                light is that for a time after the fall of France, it seemed entirely plausible that
                Stalin and Hitler would unite to knock Britain out of the war (while each
                recognizing that they were almost certainly destined to face each other in combat
                eventually.) While this book is not for the faint-hearted, I recommend it as the
                best treatment of the prelude to World War II that I have read. (And I recall that
                his first volume offered the best account of the lead up to World War I that I have
                read, even though it was not the central focus of the book.) </d:para>
            <d:para>One other note; I finished the first volume a number of years ago but it has
                taken a number of years for me to work up the enthusiasm for spending more time in
                the company of Stalin. I actually saw an interview with Prof. Kotkin recently in
                which the reviewer actually asked him how he dealt with spending so much time trying
                to get inside the head of someone most regard as a monster. Prof. Kotkin doesn't shy
                from moral judgements, but feels it is important to understand what drove him. But
                other than understanding how evil works in this world, it is hard gather much
                positive, enlightening knowledge from Stalin's life. And so, I find it helpful to
                let a few years pass between volumes. This reminds me, in a way, of my experience of
                Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag Archipelago. It was a gripping, ground-up view of life under
                Stalin but it took me ten years to finish all three volumes. After spending a time
                deeply immersed in the book, the weight of so much misery would soon require a
                break.</d:para>

            <d:para>Inherited either from Grandpa Rodine or Grandpa Krush (through Nanny). It is

            <d:para>Apparently Politics (as well as Nicomachean Ethics) are a sort of collection of
                lecture notes and not completed essays. The lack of narrative flow makes for dry
                reading, but the emphasis on terms and the structure of arguments are clear enough.
                Aristotle's analysis of politics is centered on the Greek city-states of antiquity
                (hence the tie between the Greek word for city: polis and the term politics.) As in
                his Ethics, his central focus on the ultimate "good" of the citizen and of the city.
                Unlike most modern political writers, he doesn't advocate for a particular form of
                government, although he does argue that some forms are better than others. And his
                emphasis on the rule of law in preference to the will of the ruler and a
                corresponding emphasis on moderate constitutions that balance competing interests
                within a city can be seen to have influenced the United States Constitution. It is
                interesting that John Adams so clearly adheres to the principles of a balanced,
                moderate government of virtuous citizens.</d:para>

            <d:para>From Anna's humanities seminar reading list; in a way a key to understanding the
                relationship among the large number of works she was asked to read. Mr. MacIntyre
                argues that the rejection of Aristotle's teaching on what is virtuous and what
                constitutes the "good life", beginning at the Reformation, gathering force in the
                Enlightenment and reaching fruition in modernity has produced a modern culture with
                a view of virtue that is irrational and unsustainable. After arguing that modern
                attempt to re-create / re-define virtues and morality has failed, he then proposes
                that returning to a morality based upon Aristotelian principals (defining virtues,
                defining what constitutes a "good" life, understanding means to achieve this end) is
                not only possible, but the most rational option. One key definition for Mr.
                MacIntyre is that of "practices." His definition is rather wordy, but perhaps can be
                summed up as an activity that can be mastered, that offers some practical, external
                good and, at the same time, allows the "practicer" to achieve some internal "good."
                For example, playing basketball is a practice. If a basketball player practices and
                becomes good because he wants to become a professional and earn a lot of money and
                fame, then the player has achieved the "external" goods of the practice. But if
                another player practices just as hard and becomes skilled solely for the love of the
                activity (indeed, if they would still play even if they never earned any money or if
                no one ever watched them play) then they would have achieved the "internal" goods of
                the practice. Having defined "practice", here is his summation of views: "My account
                of the virtues proceeds through three stages: a first which concerns virtues as
                qualities necessary to achieve the goods internal to practices; a second which
                considers them as qualities contributing to the good of a whole life; and third
                which relates them to the pursuit of a good for human beings the conception of which
                can only be elaborated and possessed within an ongoing social tradition." Or,
                perhaps more simply, the qualities a person needs to first learn to achieve the
                "internal goods" in their chosen activities; the ordering of these to the pursuit of
                the "good life", and the ordering of an individual's good life to contribute to a
                "good society." I am not going to lie, this is not an easy book to read, and it will
                definitely help to have read Plato's <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"

            <d:para>An extremely well balanced account of the political and military history of
                Northern Ireland. This is one of the most even-handed assessment of a political
                topic that I can remember reading; each party in the events (the Protestants and
                Catholics in the North, the British government and the Irish government) are
                criticised in both a positive and a negative manner as events dictate. While
                presenting the atrocities committed in their full gory detail, the authors do not
                exaggerate their moral judgements. As a somewhat disinterested observer, who
                remembers some of the events from press coverage "back in the day," I find much to
                reflect upon. First, our society views "democracy" as an entirely positive form of
                government, yet the creation of the government of Northern Ireland following Irish
                independence is a cautionary tale of how a democratic majority can be tyrannical.
                (Which would not surprise Plato, Aristotle or Thucydides.) In preserving absolute
                control over the political process, the Unionist ultimately were doomed to suffer
                loss of control. In rejecting the peaceful approach of the early "civil rights"
                movement, the IRA only delayed the eventual integration of Catholics into a Northern
                Ireland government. The Irish Republic and the IRA seemed to think that if the
                British left, the North would magically integrate with the South. The Irish Republic
                seemed to have realized much earlier that there could be no solution that was not
                also acceptable to the Unionists, but the IRA stubbornly clung to the idea that the
                British could be terrorised into compliance with their wishes. (Again, from a safe
                distance from events, how could the IRA think that a few bombs, no matter how
                spectacular in effect, could intimidate a nation who withstood the unrestrained
                blitz of German bombing just a generation before?) And the British government had
                little sympathy with the Unionists, yet their inept military operations only
                achieved further rancor of the Irish and Catholics. It is indeed a tragedy to
                consider that if the British Army and the IRA did not react so badly in the early
                1970s, a political solution could have developed much sooner and with many fewer
                deaths. Finally, in further confirmation that Britain and America are two countries
                divided by a common language, consider this statement: "Some like Hutchinson had
                served life sentences, spending a dozen years or more behind bars." Given that
                Hutchinson was referred to as an ex-prisoner who supported the budding peace
                process, it is clear that a "life" sentence in Britain means something different
                than in America.</d:para>

                Europe during WWII. This is just an outstanding book. Daniel Bolger is a retired
                Lieutenant General who now teaches history at NC State University. Although this is
                a very well researched book, it is not a dry, scholarly examination of the role that
                Gen. Rose and the 3rd Armored Div. played in defeating the Germans. Gen. Bolger
                writes as if he is delivering a lecture to a class of West Point cadets or junior
                officers in the Army. The prose is lively, and as the 3rd Armored Div. fights across
                France, Belgium and Germany, he weaves in asides that deal with Gen. Rose's
                upbringing, career and family as well as US Army doctrine, strategy and culture. He
                is unstinting is his praise and criticism of those involved in the events. He
                excoriates US 1st Army general Courtney Hodges; in the one instance where Gen.
                Bolger agrees with one of Gen. Hodges actions, he goes on to note that this was a
                case that reminded him of a broken clock that tells time correctly twice a day. He
                is also no fan of Gen. Omar Bradley and often questions Gen. Eisenhower's strategic
                and tactical decisions. As a writer who was a professional soldier before becoming a
                historian, he is able to </d:para>

                between the Comanches, their neighboring tribes, Mexico, Texas and the United

                Mr. Taleb describes himself as a libertarian in national politics, a Republican in
                state politics, a Democrat in local politics and a Socialist at the family level. He

            <d:para>David Bentley Hart offers a series of reflections on whether the concept of
                "universalism," the belief that all humans will be saved by God. The popular view of
                Hell is perhaps best given by Dante's inferno as a land of eternal torment suffered
                by sinners; their punishment reflecting the nature of their sin. In contrast, the
                usual argument in favor of universalism is that it is unjust for a crime of finite
                impact to be punished by infinite pain / suffering / alienation. The traditional
                view, or at least the view that I understand from the Catholic Church, is that the
                eternal nature of Hell is not the result of God's desire to punish, but a conscious
                choice of those too proud to accept the loving forgiveness of God. Perhaps the best
                illustration of this view that I have encountered is provided by C.S. Lewis' The
                Great Divorce, where residents of Hell are free to travel to heaven, but where those
                possessing excessive pride choose not to do so. Instead of eternal hell-fire, these
                residents of Hell simply grow smaller and more distant; the implication being that
                they would eventually fade to nothingness. But Dr. Hart rejects this concept.
                Probably influence by Plato and certainly influenced by such Orthodox theologians as
                ???, he argues that no truly rational being can freely reject what is best for
                themselves. And the sins that we seemingly freely choose are done so out of
                ignorance and that when finally healed by God's love even the most reprobate would
                understand where they went wrong. I can see that Mr. Nassim Taleb would reject
                universalism on the grounds that each person should have "skin in the game" and
                accept that their actions may result in damnation. But Dr. Hart does not argue that
                Hell does not exist; indeed he suggests that it is the process by which humans are
                "purged" of their sins and restored to full rational capacity. As an Orthodox
                theologian, he does not call this Purgatory, but that is the implication. The one
                big weakness of this book, in my opinion is that Mr. Hart does give a clear
                definition of hell right from the start. His use of the term is always qualified by
                linking hell with great suffering of unlimited duration. But by the end of the book,
                it becomes clear what he means. And, treating his argument as a hypothesis rather
                than as a proven fact, I would say that his argument may well be - is even likely -
                to be correct. </d:para>

            <d:para>Audio book. Jane Austen enjoys a certain degree of popularity today, and I must
                confess that I find this to be surprising. It would seem hard to attribute it to
                nostalgia, for the life and manners of her characters are alien to the mores of our
                society. I am not a big fan of literature of the Romantic era; the plot lines are
                too much like bad Hollywood movie scripts. This holds true for this novel as well.
                But she does write with style and wit. And her style and with allow her to deliver
                extended sermons on the virtues that lead to happiness and to censure vices that
                produce unhappiness. And she does this with the skill of a mother who mixes bitter
                medicine for her child with sugar.</d:para>

            <d:para>An Amazon e-book; I ordered the book after reading a review in the Wall Street
                Journal. Overall, shallow and disappointing - more like a movie script. The review
                did not discuss how much this was a send-up of the Oxford Analytica scandal in the
                aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election. But Mr. Mount offers no evidence
                that he understands how "data mining" works, and offers only shallow mockery of
                those who use these techniques in advancing their interests. Mr. Mount does write
                with pleasing style and a certain understated sense of humor. He is able to provide
                compelling caricatures of people of low moral standards and questionable intentions.
                But he offers no insight into why they act as they do, and his "sympathetic"
                characters are equally caricatures. If he were a painter, he would be a street
                artist who provides quick profile sketches. Perhaps his best moment was his
                rendering of a Donald Trump take-down of a candidate for whom his narrator was
                working. Without ever mentioning Trump's name, it was clear from the speech who he
                was portraying. Yet if Trump is one of the "bad guys", what are we to make of the
                fact that he quickly sees through the "anti-hero" of the story and summarily fires
                him while the narrator stands idly by while his boss dates (and then impregnates)
                his daughter, attempts to seduce his wife and steals the one interesting job that he
                had assigned to him? All fluff and no substance.</d:para>

            <d:para>An recorded book that I checked out from the library; the checkout ended with
                about two hours left in the book. This is a collection of interviews of residents of
                the former Soviet Union conducted by Ms. Alexievich. Although it is clear that her
                sympathies are with those who wish to bring liberal democracy and human rights to
                Russia, she allows people from all spectrums to speak freely of their feelings of
                the death of the Soviet Union and the attempt by the Russian Federation to implement
                democracy and a free market economy. It is very depressing, yet very enlightening on
                human nature in response to very challenging conditions. On one hand, it is
                difficult to listen to those who still cling to Soviet ideology and who speak with
                all the depth and subtlety of writers for Pravda or Isvestia. Yet even most of the
                die-hard Communists struggle to deal with the legacy of the Gulag. On the other
                hand, they sometimes come across as more sympathetic than some of those who adapted
                to Russian style "capitalism." Ms. Alexievich does not generally comment on the
                interviews beyond explaining the details of how she arranged the conversation. She
                rarely lets the reader know what she thinks; leaving you to draw your own
                conclusions. My chief take-away? People have an inborn need to believe in something
                greater than their own self interest. Nationalism, racial intolerance, the arts,
                philosophy all offer grounds for faith outside of religious belief. And, judging by
                its ideology, Communism is a heretical offshoot of Christianity and Judaism,
                offering the goal of "heaven" in the here and now. And Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn was
                most definitely correct when he said the line between good and evil runs through the
                heart of every man. The thing is, that the line isn't generally exposed until one is
                under great pressure. Here in America, we have been fortunate to have had very
                little of such pressure; Russia, on the other hand, has been a great laboratory of
                suffering for much of its history. And while we in America celebrated the end of the
                Cold War and generally forgot all about the former Soviet Union, in Russia the
                transition unleashed new rounds of suffering. Finally, I had the great opportunity
                to visit the Soviet Union in 1990, in the last days of the Soviets. This book makes
                me wonder how things turned out for my friends from that visit.</d:para>

            <d:para>Bruce Springsteen hit the big time when I was in high school with his album
                "Born in the USA." This is when I first became interested in his music. In college,
                I explored his earlier albums such as "Born to Run" and "The River" and while he
                continued to make albums, I found his earlier work more interesting than his later
                work. As he released "Tunnel of Love", "Human Touch", "Lucky Town" and the rising, I
                continued to buy the albums and enjoy the music, but his songs just did not contain
                the same power or interest. I felt that in his early music, he was telling the
                stories of real people in real life; in his later work he was more often standing on
                a soap box and preaching. As an illustration, consider the opening lines to "Thunder
                Road" from "Born to Run", released in 1975. "The screen door slams, Mary's dress
                sways / Like a vision, she dances across the porch as the radio plays / Roy Orbison
                singing for the lonely / Hey, that's me, and I want you only …" In this song, the
                listener is transported to a particular location in a particular moment in the lives
                of two characters - the unnamed narrator and his girl Mary. Now take the song
                "You're Missing" from "The Rising" released in 2001: "Shirts in the closet, shoes in
                the hall/ Mama’s in the kitchen, baby and all / Everything is everything /
                Everything is everything / But you're missing …" The earlier song, dealing with the
                angst of two young lovers, is much more compelling than the later song dealing with
                the angst of those who lost loved ones in the 9/11 attacks. Now this is a
                long-winded introduction to my feelings about the work of Bruce Springsteen. I love
                his early work, like his later work, admire the energy he brings to his live
                performance (although I have never personally attended a concert) and find little
                interest in what he says or does outside the world of music. And this observation is
                my segue into my review of his autobiography written in 2016. First of all, props to
                Mr. Springsteen for not using a ghost writer. And while a ghost writer might of
                tightened up some sections of the book, I don't thing anyone could have written this
                story as well as Mr. Springsteen. For he writes his story with all the brilliant
                details that I love in his early work. For instance, he describes his childhood
                memory of his mother getting ready to go to work by describing the sounds he heard
                as she did her hair and put on her makeup. As well as his eye (and ear) for detail,
                he is very honest and forthright about the emotional turmoil in his home life as a
                child, his attempts to reconcile this conflict as an adult and his struggles with
                his father's (and his own) bouts of mental illness. He is a brash, energetic and
                bombastic showman with a wide streak of self-righteousness and that is conveyed in
                his writing (and generally recognized and acknowledged.) So the reader has to take
                this book with at least one grain of salt. He has a natural tendency to rebel
                against authority yet has no problem exerting his own authority in shaping and
                implementing his artistic vision (again, something he recognizes and acknowledges.)
                But he is also quick to acknowledge that he is anxious, self-conscious, insecure and
                unsure of what to make of his success. And he a strong belief in the love of family
                and friends and band mates and his place of birth; as well as an unorthodox but
                strong faith in God. I was expecting an entertaining book chronically the "high
                life" of a rock star - and was not disappointed in this regard - but what I really
                found was an extended meditation on love, family and faith. In Anna's freshman year
                humanities seminar at Notre Dame, she had to read Aristotle's "Nicomachean Ethics"
                and write an essay examining whether LeBron James exhibited the qualities of one who
                lead the "good life." Bruce Springsteen would have been a much more interesting case
                study. Aristotle defines the virtues necessary for the "good life" as a balance
                between two extremes - courage is the mean between lack of courage (cowardice) and
                too much courage (rashness). Someone, like Bruce, with a lack of musical education
                and a poor singing voice may never have ventured onto a stage, and thus have
                succumbed to cowardice. On the other extreme many rock stars have rashly pushed
                their life style to a foolhardy extreme and have died an early death. Although Bruce
                never acknowledges Aristotle, he does discuss the virtues that were necessary for
                his success and acknowledges his fear of loosing control of himself. Aristotle
                distinguishes between practical wisdom and contemplative wisdom. Practical wisdom in
                Bruce's case being his mastery of the details of guitar playing, song writing,
                performance and the production of music. Anna noted that for Lebron, you could see
                evidence of the virtues and of practical wisdom but there was no public evidence of
                contemplative wisdom. Bruce, in his autobiography does provide indication that he
                thinks about his actions in a bigger scheme than just his own life. I would say the
                act of writing his autobiography was itself an act of contemplation. While in some
                areas he can be said to lack wisdom in spite of his contemplation, I think that in
                what he has discovered that is of most importance to him, he has achieved some level
                of the good life. But his biography is not an essay on Ethics; I suspect that if
                anything Bruce would say it is a mediation on life and art. As he state in the book
                "Life trumps art - always" and this is the chronicle of a real life that is every
                bit as compelling as the best of his early work.</d:para>

            <d:para>Audio Book. Mr Gaiman put his own spin on a collection of Norse myths. At times,
                he is a bit too colloquial but only rarely. I was generally struck with his
                distinctive style. His prose can be as serious and poetic as a modernized version of
                the King James Bible, and also funny without being silly. And he reads his own book
                for this recording. At some points, his voice can be too swarmy and cute, but again
                this is the exception more than the rule. His British accent does a good job of
                making the myths seem "foreign" and he has a way of enunciating each and every
                syllable of a word that engages the listener's attention.</d:para>

            <d:para>Audio Book. Edison is a tremendously interesting personality, and Mr. Morris
                does a respectable job covering his personal life with his work as an inventor and
                entrepreneur. But this book has a fatal flaw. Mr. Morris covers Edison's life
                backwards - beginning with his last years, then moving backwards one decade at a
                time. I seem to remember some hullabaloo about this approach with another Morris
                biography (Reagan, perhaps?). But this is the first work by this author that I have
                read, so I can't say for sure. What I can say is that I am not a fan. It would make
                sense if he wanted to examine particular effects of Edison's career and then work
                backwards to the causes. But he simply starts at the end, jumps back 10 years to
                cover the decade in chronological order, then repeats until he reaches Edison's
                birth. Personally, I was annoyed by the approach. I am left with the suspicion that
                he does not want the reader to reach his own conclusions as he works through the
                material. The second big complaint is that he does not cover in great deal the
                impact that Edison's inventions had on society. Of course, it is impossible to
                overlook the impact of his perfection of the incandescent light bulb and the means
                to distribute power efficiently. But he doesn't go beyond the obvious. On the plus
                side, his style is engaging and his approach is balanced when evaluating issues
                relating to competing claims on patents.</d:para>

            <d:para>Recommended by my friend Ed Schmitt. A fictional embellishment of a true (and
                very interesting) story, but not well written. To simplistic, as if Mr. Sullivan
                were writing a movie script instead of a novel. Mr. Sullivan has some difficulty
                putting the characters in their historical milieu and they come across as modern
                people dropped into an earlier time. For instance, at one point a stranger offers
                the family a drink from his whiskey bottle. One young lady is eager to accept, but
                is prohibited by her mother. The girl complains "But Mom, I'm 21 years old" as if
                the American drinking age laws applied in World War II Romania. But Mr. Sullivan
                does introduce the reader to an unforgettable character - Corporal Gheorghe. His
                musings on life, faith and destiny are compelling and provide an unexpected depth to
                an otherwise simplistic novel.</d:para>

            <d:para>I am a big fan of Dr. Guelzo's history of the Battle of Gettysburg, and enjoy
                his essays in the Wall Street Journal and First Things. So I was anxious to read his
                treatment of General Lee. As a biography, his book was somewhat disappointing in
                that it offered a straightforward retelling of his life with an emphasis on trying
                to understand Lee's personality and motivations. Dr. Guelzo is neither blinded by
                admiration nor scorn in treating his subject. But what makes this book interesting
                are its introduction and conclusion. In the introduction, Dr. Guelzo asks the
                question of why one should expend effort on writing the biography of one who was a
                traitor to his country. And that is one of the themes of his coverage of Lee's life
                - examining how someone whose political sympathies (inherited from his prominent
                family) seemed to lean of the nationalist Federalist / Whig viewpoints rather than
                the sectarian Democrats could turn his back on his country at the moment of supreme
                crisis. He seems to think that Lee's decision was driven by his loyalty to his
                family and since his family owned land in Virginia (most notably right across the
                Potomac from DC at Arlington) and his family stood to suffer if that land were
                threatened, he cast his lot with his native state. Then, in the conclusion of the
                book, Dr. Guelzo examines Lee's legacy - first in the South and then in the present
                day with its fixation on identity politics and a widespread desire to erase any
                memory of the Confederacy. Guelzo is puzzled that our contemporaries look on Lee
                with disgust since he fought to preserve slavery (and, by extension, the concept of
                "white supremacy.") Lee certainly believed that free black slaves were not worthy of
                full citizenship or of social equality. But his views on this were little different
                than the vast majority of white Americans in 1865. Guelzo points out the Lee
                professed willingness to drop slavery to preserve the union, actually freed his own
                slaves during the course of the war, and by wars end was advocating the enlistment
                of slaves with the promise of freedom. Guelzo does not make this point to justify
                Lee - noting that he was fighting to defend a rebellion motivated by the
                preservation of slavery. But Guelzo is puzzled that modern society condemns more his
                attitudes on race rather than his decision to betray his country. And this is a view
                with which I have some sympathy. My time on active duty in the Navy was spent
                stationed in the south and found it ironic that military bases were named for people
                who fought to destroy their county. One aspect of Lee's decision that I thing Guelzo
                overlooks is the difference in one's political loyalties for people in 1860 than in
                2021. I know no one, (with the possible exception of a stereotypical Texan) who
                would place their loyalty with their state rather than with their nation. But I
                think that for many in the early years of the United States, the decision would not
                be as clear.</d:para>

            <d:para>Borrowed from Thomas. Covers the history of North America prior to the
                conclusion of the 7 Years / French &amp; Indian War. Mr. Richter emphasizes the
                cross-Atlantic interaction of cultures - this provides a much broader view of
                cultural and economic influences than is usually provided. He does not have an axe
                to grind, and presents the positive and negative aspects of all involved. He makes
                one observation that I found unconvincing, noting that the period of Gothic
                cathedral building in northern Europe roughly corresponded to the period of mound
                building and Pueblo construction in North America. He speculates that global climate
                change was somehow responsible; yet cathedral building had been going on in Europe
                long before the Gothic period. That observation aside, he is surely correct that the
                even in the late mediaeval period changes in climate had wide ranging economic and
                political ramifications.</d:para>

            <d:para>Audio book. A reasonably competent biography marred by an annoying reader. The
                best part about this book is the use the author makes of JQA's diaries and letters.
                What I found most interesting was his treatment of Abigail Adams. Based upon Page
                Smith's biography of John Adams, we are left with the impression of an intelligent
                and charming woman who participated in a loving and supportive relationship with her
                husband. And it is my impression that she is regarded as one of the most popular and
                accomplished first ladies (and by popular, I mean with the opinion of present day
                Americans.) But Mr. Nagel, while noting the positive aspects of her character, also
                presents an less appealing side - that of an over-bearing, critical and demanding
                mother (note, John is also portrayed as an over-bearing, critical and demanding
                father.) For all his education, experience and accomplishments, JQA comes off as
                insecure, anxious and neurotic. Indeed, by Mr. Nagel's view, these traits describe
                nearly all the members of the Adams family (with the possible exception of JQA's
                sister Abigail). I found this portrayal to be particularly thought provoking when
                contrasted with Alasdair MacIntyre's examination of "virtue." The John, Abigail and
                JQA all believe fervently in a sense of virtue very compatible with Aristotle's
                "Nicomachean Ethics" and "Politics." Yet, by their own words and examples, they come
                across more as "Pharisees" who are as much motivated by public perception as they
                are of a true love of what is good. Indeed, the exhortations to virtuous behavior
                are often accompanied by threats of the loss or withholding of love and esteem. It
                seems odd that something that should offer so much benefit can be attended by so
                much angst. By coincidence, during Advent, I read the "Vine and Branches" discourse
                in John Chapter 15, in particular verse 10: "If you keep my commandments, you will
                abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his
                love." Equating the keeping of the Old Testament commandments with the concept of
                promoting the classical virtues, it would seem that Christ calls us to be virtuous
                in order to grow in love rather than simply to avoid damnation. But these are just
                my ruminations; this biography does not deal with such philosophical speculation.

            <d:para>I entered the Navy on July 7, 1986 when I was inducted into the Naval Academy.
                On July 8, 1986 Admiral Rickover died. I had never heard of Admiral Rickover, and
                even if the news of his death had been relayed to us newly minted plebes, it left no
                impression on my memory. However, by the time I graduated from Annapolis I was fully
                aware that the Navy still walked in his shadow. In my time at Annapolis, I can
                recall three people with larger than life reputations among the midshipmen. First
                was Col. John Ripley whose exploits at the Dong Ha bridge in Vietnam were
                commemorated in a small diorama in Memorial Hall. Next was James Webb whose novel "A
                Sense of Honor" was the source of controversy at Annapolis and whose short stint as
                Secretary of the Navy was the source of controversy on the national political scene.
                Admiral Rickover was the third - in addition to being the father of the nuclear navy
                and the namesake of the engineering building at Annapolis; the stories of his
                practice of personally interviewing all officers who were candidates for the
                submarine service were still recalled with both humor and horror. The one story I
                recall is that one ensign was asked by Adm Rickover to do or say something that
                would make him upset. After a moment's consideration, the ensign picked up the model
                submarine from the Admiral's desk and smashed it to pieces. </d:para>
            <d:para>Rear Admiral Oliver states that his goal was to write a study on Rickover's
                management style with an eye towards application in civilian business. Personally, I
                think that his book is closer to a memoir based upon his personal interactions with
                Rickover. While some of the myths that surround Rickover are confirmed, his actions
                are explained as a largely successful effort to deploy a new (and potentially
                dangerous) technology while simultaneously transforming Navy culture to properly
                handle this technology. Given the successful outcome of his efforts, he certainly
                must be ranked as the most influential Navy admiral in the entire Cold War era. RADM
                Oliver makes a distinction between leadership and management and asserts that
                Rickover was not a leader but a phenomenally successful manager. But I believe that
                RADM Oliver is too narrow in his definition of a leader. He equates leadership with
                the concept of "command presence" and links this vision of leadership closely with
                the ability to successfully exercise command at sea. He implies that the "command
                presence" model of leadership is very similar to business leadership. And because
                Adm Rickover's personal skills were deemed lacking long before the current era of
                extreme "political correctness," he fails as a leader in RADM Oliver's eyes. But he
                undercuts his own argument when he examines Rickover's seeming ability to predict
                the future and his success in creating an effective and safe nuclear Navy. I would
                argue that Rickover illustrates the classic tension between leadership in
                unforgiving wartime conditions versus that in everyday life. Be that as it may, RADM
                Oliver has succeeded in illuminating the "man behind the myth" in a thoughtful and
                highly entertaining way. Indeed, given RADM Oliver's masterful "sea stories," this
                book is an early candidate for the most entertaining book of 2022.</d:para>

            <d:para>Stacy and I gave this book to both Thomas and Anna for Christmas. A collection
                of short stories by an Orthodox priest. Each of the stories involve an Albanian
                Orthodox priest - Father Zaum - and episodes in the fictional parish of St.
                Alexander the Whirling Dervish in northeastern Philadelphia. I suspect that these
                stories are Fr. Siniari’s equivalents to RADM Oliver's sea stories; instead of
                reflecting on the leadership qualities of a great navy admiral, these stories
                reflect on what it means to be a good priest. In terms of style, Fr. Siniari really
                could have used a good editor, there are moments when he seems to want to avoid
                being wordy but leaves the reader somewhat confused - usually this happens when the
                action in a story jumps from one time period to another. In spite of these

            <d:para>Audio book. The basic plot is interesting, but coming to the story after nearly
                a lifetime of exposure to a seemingly endless series of adaptations, it has lost its
                ability to surprise. Stylistically, I would classify this as late Romantic in tone
                and it is easy to contrast the novel with Frankenstein - an early romantic piece.
                Frankenstein succeed better as a philosophical reflection on science and morality;
                Dracula is more a reflection of modern society's unease with a skeptical scientific
                outlook that claims to explain all. Also, it is an interesting treatment of the
                cream of society who have been raised in a thoroughly Christian (and Protestant)
                society, but who think primarily in scientific and economic terms and secondarily in
                Christian outlook. Dracula's greatest fault is that Stoker's primary tool to create
                dramatic tension is to place innocent women into mortal peril. I would have
                overlooked this, but once he killed off one female character, he found it necessary
                to almost immediately place another women into the same straits. its characters are
                far too wordy. This is compounded by the quality of the actors reading the story.
                Mostly they do a good job, but the actor's rendition of VanHelsing nearly drove me
                to abandon this book. In addition to being an awful attempt at a Dutch accent, each
                syllable was enunciated and drawn out ( for instance Madam Mina became MadaaMEEEEna)
                and probably added an extra half hour to the recording. </d:para>

            <d:para>Another book from Thomas' course on Byzantine literature. This is a short poem
                by an unknown poet regarding a convocation of all the animals called by the king
                Lion. The purpose of the meeting is allegedly for the animals to speak and learn
                about each other. Yet after a series of testy, boastful and mocking exchanges, the
                Lion launches a pre-emptive assault by the carnivores upon the herbivores. Most of
                the book consists of commentary by the translators, trying to determine how far this
                work should be read as social or political satire on late Byzantine society. A nice
                feature is a section of black and white copies of illustrations from a manuscript
                copy held in Istanbul. Overall, not particularly interesting to the modern reader,
                but it is useful to see what people in other times and places found to be

            <d:para>Ordered this book mostly for nostalgic reasons. When I was a kid, the Orioles,
                managed by Earl Weaver, were one of baseball's best teams and Jim Palmer was the
                most recognizable player. Weaver was famous (or infamous) for his tantrums directed
                at umpires when he disagreed with their calls and the relationship between Palmer
                and Weaver was known to be combustible as well. This book is a collection of
                anecdotes by Palmer, mostly relating to his interactions with Weaver. Conversational
                in style, (I'm guessing Palmer told stories and Dale wrote them down) and told
                mostly for entertainment. Palmer occasionally has an axe to grind, but mostly all is
                in good fun. As an aside, in the late 1970's the Johns Hopkins Medical School would
                host a cookout in the bullpen of Memorial Stadium and Nanny took us a couple of
                times. In the course of the festivities, a few players would swing by for
                autographs. Mostly they were backups such as Dave Skaggs or of lesser star power
                such as Rick Dempsey. But the highlight of my experience was when Jim Palmer
                wandered over to the fence separating the bullpen from the playing field and signed
                autographs. </d:para>

            <d:para>Mr. MacIntyre's contribution to the Gifford Lectures given at the University of
                Edinburgh. ??? Gifford endowed the lectures to carry on discussion of theology in
                general and moral inquiry in particular. MacIntyre examines the assumptions made by
                Gifford, and labels this period in the development of moral inquiry as the
                "encyclopedia" phase. It was based on the assumption that theology would develop
                along the same lines as the physical sciences and that all subjects could be fully
                developed and understood in light of the standards developed in the Enlightenment.
                Mr. MacIntyre then notes that in the present day, the fragmentation of philosophy
                into multiple "schools" that are mutually unintelligible has proven that Gifford's
                assumptions have not borne out. He then points to Nietzsche's The Genealogy of
                Morals as the breaking point of the encyclopedic approach. He labels this group as
                the Genealogists, who argue that there is no common understanding or even
                possibility of common understanding given that all morality is a reflection on the
                individual's will to power. MacIntyre notes that both the encyclopedic and
                genealogical approaches are united in their rejection of the traditionalist approach
                as created by St. Thomas Aquinas. But MacIntyre, as a committed "Thomist" suggests
                that the only possibility of these three approaches to ever exam each other's
                approaches critically is to follow in the footsteps of Aquinas. He then explores how
                Aquinas learned from both the Augustinian theology/philosophy dominant in his day
                and the rising influence of Aristotelian thinking. Rather than picking one side over
                the other, Aquinas' approach was to fully immerse himself in both lines of thinking
                and only after coming to an understanding of both approaches, to offer a synthesis
                of the two. MacIntyre then briefly explores how such a process could play out
                between the three versions of moral enquiry that he has explored. He goes so far as
                to question the ability of the modern "liberal" university to ever justify its
                continued existence without embracing such an approach. This is a very thought
                provoking book, but as with After Virtue, his style is dense. It is not uncommon for
                single sentences to take up a paragraph worth of real estate on the page. I can't
                imagine having listened to the actual lecture, but maybe it would be more easily
                understood that way. But for all the philosophical nuance (notice how the term
                "philosophical" has taken on an almost negative connotation in contemporary
                English), his suggestion that Aquinas had discovered the best approach to
                theological / philosophical / moral study is easy to grasp and passes the common
                sense test of plausibility. </d:para>

            <d:para>An audio book checked out from the library. When I was a boy, Kissinger was one
                of the most recognizable names of anyone in government. I think that most held him
                in high regard, but he was also a lightening rod for fierce criticism. Mr.
                Isaacson's biography is a rather balanced examination of Kissinger's career up
                through the mid-1990's. Isaacson presents all of his accomplishments, but always in
                a "yes, but" acknowledgement that precedes a discussion of dissenting views and
                consideration of what Kissinger could have done instead. Stylistically, this makes
                for a somewhat choppy narrative. Indeed, it is somewhat like St. Thomas Aquinas'
                Summa Theologica: he presents an episode, then presents dissenting arguments, then
                supporting arguments, then provides his own opinion. This approach is very thought
                provoking, but at the end, one is left with the feeling that Kissinger was quite
                brilliant but would have really been something if he had only shared Mr. Isaacson's
                view on how to run foreign policy. But personally, after finishing the book, I have
                a much greater appreciation for Kissinger's intelligence and approach to policy.
                While Mr. Isaacson may be correct that Kissinger could have been more effective as a
                manager of a bureaucratic organization and perhaps he would have benefited from
                being less secretive. But, as Mr. Isaacson says that he worked for Time Magazine he
                is surely biased to always favor openness to secrecy. And, given the arguments and
                sources he cites, he is surely of the liberal wing of the foreign policy
                "Establishment" view that held from the end of WWII at least until the Reagan
                administration. But, to his credit, he is always at least willing to explore
                Kissinger's explanation when their views differ. Finally, my favorite anecdote from
                the book was the description of Kissinger’s boar hunt with Breshnev in Russia.
                Breshnev had a country retreat and a large stand where he could hunt boar. Before
                the hunt, the stand was well stocked with food, tea and vodka and the game keeper
                had laid out a trail of grain to lead the boars within range of the stand.</d:para>

            <d:para>Audio book from the library. The Library's interface for browsing audio books
                leaves a lot to be desired; based on the description the book appeared to be about
                Russia, business and murder. In this case, taking a chance paid off. Mr. Browder has
                a gift for narrating a story and his account of getting involved in business in
                Russia in the early 1990's was riveting. But then things became much more serious
                when I realized that the murder in question was of that of Sergei Magnitsky, who
                died in detention in a Russian jail. Mr. Browder continues with his efforts to
                achieve some sort of justice, including the passage of the "Magnitsky Act"
                sanctioning those involved in his murder. A very entertaining and enlightening book
                that is clearly intended as one more salvo in his ongoing fight with Russian
                authorities. If I have one complaint, it is that his attacks on Putin and corrupt
                officials is painted with such a broad brush that he often appears to paint all of
                Russia in the same dark tones. For an unsophisticated American audience, this is no
                flaw, but if he were interested in influence Russian popular opinion this is a big
                drawback. But that is a minor complaint and does not prevent me from heartily
                recommending this book.</d:para>

            <d:para>A very thoughtful and thought provoking book. As the title clearly states, it is
                about China and does provide some historical background. But it is about American
                relations with China in particular by the man who helped facilitate the
                establishment of relations between the US and Red China. The more I read by
                Kissinger (and about Kissinger) the more I am impressed by his intellectual
                curiosity and balance; he truly seems to want to understand all sides of an issue
                rather than shape the issue to fit a particular viewpoint. As an example, I remember
                the Tianammen Square massacre from my college days, and like most Americans, viewed
                it through the lens of the last days of the Cold War when there was a feeling that
                Communism was rapidly collapsing. So the Chinese actions were viewed as the corrupt
                actions of aging Communists acting against idealistic youths supporting democratic
                values. Kissinger points out that in the Cultural Revolution, Mao turned the youth
                of China against all established institutions including the Communist party
                establishment. Deng was ousted from power and exiled, and his son was paralyzed when
                he was thrown from the roof of a school building by members of the "Red Guards." For
                survivors of this period, such as Deng, this was obviously traumatic and also viewed
                as the waste of 10 years of development in the modernization of China. Not that
                Kissinger justifies sending in tanks against unarmed protesters, but he offers
                insight into Chinese leadership that I had never heard from the mainstream
                media.</d:para>

            <d:para>Two titles in a single audio book from the library. This is the second time

                argument to counter David Bentley Hart's argument that in the end all will be saved.
                Lewis argues that if those in heaven cannot rest content if anyone is not saved,
                then those who would continue to chose evil would, in effect, hold the heavenly in
                their control. And in the Great Divorce, he presents plausible examples of those who
                would chose something else over heaven. But, perhaps, the greatest weakness of
                Lewis' argument is that his heavenly select seek to convert those at risk of

                a consciousness that extends beyond the physical nature of the body, he prefers to
                refer to "transcendental nature" than to the "soul." I believe this choice in words
                is driven by Fr. Spitzer's desire to reach an audience of scientists and
                philosophers. In fact, given the title, I can picture someone looking for some work
                of sappy earnestness (such as "Chicken Soup for the Soul") picking this book up only
                to be hit with intricate philosophical points and discussion of quantum physics. It
                is hard work getting through this book. Stylistically, just as in the first book in
                this series, Fr. Spitzer's style is pedantic (in a good sense) - he strives for
                clear exposition of concepts with frequent repetition of key concepts. But perhaps
                the evidence he provides for trans-physical nature of human consciousness makes the
                difficult style necessary in order to convince a skeptical scientific audience as
                opposed to shoring up the conviction of the already converted. </para>

            <d:para>Audio book from the library. Sometimes you get something good when picking a
                book, and sometimes you get a dud. This is closer to the latter. His subtitle states
                "What America's Founders Learned from the Greeks and Romans and How that Shaped Our
                Country." A more accurate subtitle would state "What America's Founders Learned from
                the Greeks and Romans and How Our Country Rejected that Knowledge." Mr. Ricks sets
                out with an intriguing idea, examine how an education in the classics shaped four of
                our founding fathers - Washington, Jefferson, Adams and Madison. But he provides
                only a cursory examination of the classics and how they shaped each founder;
                especially when Washington had scant formal education. But Washington could still
                have provided an interesting case study of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics in
                comparing "practical wisdom" against "contemplative wisdom." But Mr. Ricks'
                knowledge of the classics seems rudimentary and he is content to cherry pick quotes
                and cite secondary sources. And he diverges far and wide from his stated intention;
                focusing on a general chronological narrative with excursions into political and
                military developments. It is telling that his diversions are generally more
                instructive that his main thesis.</d:para>

            <d:para>An audiobook from the library that I checked out before I had finished To Kill a
                Mockingbird (TKaM). A few years ago, there was a big deal made about the release of
                this book. I didn't pay much attention, but it was my impression that this was an
                unfinished sequel to TKaM and that many people were not pleased with the depiction
                of Atticus Finch. As I started listening, I was struck by a number of passages that
                seemed to be taken word-for-word from TKaM - this seemed odd if the book were
                intended as a sequel. Then I read that Go Set A Watchman was actually an early draft
                of what eventually became TKaM. I nearly stopped listening assuming that this was a
                ploy by the publisher to cash in on the enduring popularity of TKAM. But I
                persevered as I do enjoy her writing. The next hurdle to overcome was what I felt to
                be an unrealistic attempt to drive conflict when Jean Louise discovers her father
                attending a meeting at which the featured speaker is an avowed white supremacist. At
                this point, the work turned from a series of recollections of her childhood that
                dovetailed with TKaM to a series of angry interior monologues and exterior shouting
                matches with her loved ones. At first, I found this annoying but figured that Ms.
                Lee was exploring a number of concepts before settling on the final plot of TKaM.
                But then I discovered that these monologues, arguments and speeches were actually
                very thoughtful explorations of southern culture and politics, both dealing with the
                relations between white and black, between cultured and uncultured whites, and
                between family members of different generations. As a work of literature, Go Set A
                Watchman is a failed early attempt as a novel. But as a collection of character
                sketches and essays, I was fascinated by this book. Ms. Lee pulls no punches in
                analyzing both the strengths and weaknesses of southern culture and of those who
                criticize it from the outside. I am amused at the thought of today's shallow,
                superficial, social-media culture trying to wrap their heads around Ms. Lee's
                nuanced ruminations. </d:para>

            <d:para>An audio book from the library. Not a typical mystery in which a detective
                attempts to solve a crime; rather an involved plot by a criminal with the typical
                emphasis on figuring out "who dunnit?" Well written and entertaining, but utterly
                improbable. For instance, I doubt whether Ms. Christie ever had personal experience
                with firing a handgun, or else she would not seriously contemplate a fake shooting
                inside a house in which no one hears the report of the revolver nor notes the
                absence of the lingering odor of cordite. But overall, I was willing to suspend
                disbelief in order to enjoy the tale as if it were a movie thriller with a
                complicated plot. In the end, although this was intellectually stimulating, it was
                emotionally unsatisfying.</d:para>

                narrator. Pyle, the American, is unconvincing; Fowler, the cynical British reporter

                Augustus, Trajan, Constantine and Justinian. Finally, his final chapter on the First

            <d:para>A well researched biography of a career bench player in Major League Baseball

            <d:para>Part murder-mystery story, part character study and part humorous satire on life
                in a small town on the Mississippi. It is easy to see why this novella hasn't
                remained popular. First, while he does consider the folly of human bondage and its
                degrading impact on human character, today's preference is for this topic to be
                handled with high moral outrage and condemnation rather than with irony. Second,
                while the idea of someone being acquitted or convicted based upon finger prints may
                have seemed groundbreaking at the time this was written, it is now too commonplace

            <d:para>Subtitled: Ulysses S. Grant, The Fragile Union, and the Crisis of 1876. Mr.
                Baier is a TV correspondent and states that he does not view himself as a historian
                but as a "reporter" of history. At least he is honest, for this book is a rather
                shallow overview of the life of Grant with a particular focus on the contested
                election of 1876. For an in-depth evaluation of his life, Bruce Catton and Ron
                Chernow are much more in depth. I presume that Ms. Whitney has done most of the
                research; but whoever did the research can be commended for at least providing some
                fresh sources. For instance, I hadn't realized that Julia Grant had written her own
                memoir and this book benefits from greater details about Grant's family life. Plus
                it credits Grant with one of the funniest "lawyer" jokes I've heard. During a
                particularly low point in his life, when Grant moved to Galena, Illinois to work for
                his father, he walked into a bar frequented by lawyers. "One of the lawyers noticed
                Grant: 'Stranger here?' he asked. Grant said yes. 'Traveled far?' 'Far enough.'
                'Looks as though you might have traveled though hell,' the lawyer joked. 'I have.'
                'Well, how did you find things down there?' 'Oh, much the same as in Galena,' Grant
                deadpanned. 'Lawyers nearest the fire.' "</d:para>

            <d:para>This book can be described as a cross between Bram Stoker's <emphasis

                    xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Harry Potter</emphasis> and the Father
                Brown mysteries. Set in Europe just after the turn of the 20th century and featuring
                a multi-national cast of characters, the influence of Dracula is obvious. But Ms.
                Nicholson's style is much less melodramatic and verbose than Mr. Stoker's. While
                Athene Howard, the main character, is British her outlook and behavior seem closer
                to modern day America than to Edwardian England. This, and the supernatural subject
                matter, recall Harry Potter. The intelligence and wit of some of the members of the
                religious orders as well as the sneaky way in which Catholic doctrine is espoused
                bring the Father Brown mysteries to mind. An enjoyable book, but the author seems to
                be aiming towards a series of books which inevitably detracts from the "literary"
                qualities of the story.</d:para>

            <d:para>An audiobook from the library. The sub-title doesn't lie; this was more a
                personal biography than an examination of her politics and exercise of power. As
                much as I admired Mr. Massie's <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
                    >Dreadnaught</emphasis> and <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
                    >Castles of Steel</emphasis>, this work wasn't up to the same standard. Like
                most modern Western historians, he seems to have only a superficial understanding of
                the Orthodox Church. Although his constant misuse of the "Mass" instead of "Liturgy"
                in reference to Orthodox Church services may seem perhaps a superficial complaint, I
                think it is a perfect example of his lack of understanding. Nevertheless,
                Catherine's rise to power was quite remarkable and Mr. Massie lists her as one of
                the two most important and influential Tsars in Russian history (there is a reason
                both Peter I and Catherine II earned the sobriquet of "the Great".) But the breadth
                of analysis of her reign does not show the same insight as that of his coverage of
                Lord Salisbury or Winston Churchill in his naval histories. Interestingly, some of
                the incidents in Catherine's reign could have been taken from today's news
                headlines. For instance, the handling of the Moscow plague in the early 1770s and
                the conflict with the Turks in what is now the southern Ukraine, involving the
                Crimea and cities such as Mikolaev and Odessa. The other interesting point he makes
                is that the story of the "Potemkin villages," supposedly staged by Grigory Potemkin
                as Catherine traveled through he recently acquired territory along the Dnieper
                River, is most likely false. Indeed, Massie holds Potemkin in high esteem.</d:para>

            <d:para>This book is one of those that is difficult to assign a number grade. One one
                hand, the plot and style are typical of the Victorian era. For some reason I was
                reminded of Black Beauty, although it has been many years since I've read that book.
                But the unique images he conjures outside the realm of the "real" world are
                fascinating. His "nursery rhymes," often variations on very famous rhymes such as
                "Little Bo Beep" are very well done. I particularly enjoyed the fairy tale "Princess
                Daylight." There was a period in my reading life, around the time I was in fifth and
                sixth grade, where I particularly enjoyed collections of folk tales. While this book
                is too long to be considered a "tale," it's atmospheric effect is similar. Plus, Mr.
                MacDonald has a wry sense of humor. The main character is Diamond, and at one point
                in the story some is reported as having complained that this was not a proper
                Biblical name. Diamond's mother (if I remember correctly) points out - chapter and
                verse - exactly where in the Old Testament the word diamond can be found.</d:para>

            <d:para>An audiobook from the library. I suppose the main topic of the book is Post
                Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The author states that this book grew out of a
                magazine article that he had written, but it didn’t grow very much. First, the bad.
                He is who has in interest in a topic, takes a stack of medical and social science
                studies, and declaims as if he is an expert. He sprinkles his narrative with
                statistics and citations of studies. But because the book is not particularly well
                organized, he often contradicts himself. For example, he cites statistics of much
                lower rates of suicide in the civilian population during wartime, yet provides
                anecdotes during the Serbian siege of Sarajevo in the 1990's of people deliberately
                walking into sniper fire to end their lives. He notes characteristics of the lives
                of indigenous people in the modern era and assumes that the lives of our ancestors
                was very much the same. He does not seem to cast a critical eye on the studies that
                he cites. Yet, despite the many flaws in his work, he does ask some very probing
                questions about why, in the richest society in history, there is so much spiritual
                malaise (my term, not his.)</d:para>

            <d:para>Luttwak offers a very interesting analysis of why the Byzantine Empire lasted so
                long. You could learn the main points of his argument by simply reading the
                concluding chapter. All the preceding chapters due support his conclusions, but not
                in a well organized, linear fashion. Stylistically, he is a bit flippant at times;
                not that the book would have been better by being more serious. It seems that when
                he has an insight onto the Byzantine approach to warfare or diplomacy, he is apt to
                throw in a comment that ranges far afield but confuses as much as illuminates. I
                didn't bother recording any examples, as this is a minor complaint. Much more
                interesting are his investigations into the evolution of the Roman army under the
                Byzantines; for instance the vaunted Roman legions were replaced by heavy cavalry
                using composite bows in imitation of the Huns. He also pays much closer attention to
                Byzantine relations with their neighbors and their efforts in "grooming" their
                neighbors' neighbors. The following quotes, I think, offer a good summary of his
                thoughts: "The tacit understanding was that once that the enemy was destroyed, there
                would be peace. The Byzantines knew better. They knew that peace was a temporary
                interruption of war, that as soon as one enemy is defeated, another would take up
                his place in attacking the empire. hence the loss of scarce and valuable soldiers to
                inflict attrition was irreversible, while the strategic gains could only be
                temporary. Even the destruction of the enemy was not a definitive gain, because in
                the unending war, yesterday's enemy could become the best ally. … Whenever possible,
                the Byzantines tried to avoid the frontal attacks and rigid stands that inflict and
                cost high casualties, relying on maneuver instead to fight the enemy by raiding on
                the offensive and by ambushing on the defensive, by containment, by outflanking, and
                by enveloping, different ways of winning by disruption rather than destruction." pg.
                58 "So why would anyone fight in any other way? The first reason is that to uncover
                the enemy strengths to be avoided and weaknesses that can be exploited, the enemy
                itself must be understood, and that requires an intellectual effort, and also an
                emotional effort to overcome hatred, for there can be no deep understanding without
                empathy. The Byzantines too may have hated their enemies but apparently not enough
                to prevent them from understanding their characteristics. Even if not blinded by
                hatred, the powerful and the ignorant may simply lack the elemental curiosity to
                study the enemy."pg. 287-288</d:para>

            <d:para>Found this at the library. What a disappointment. This book is disorganized,
                clumsily written and littered with small factual errors. Given the high quality of
                his earlier works, I have the impression that someone found an incomplete
                manuscript, stitched the pieces together as well as they could and then sent the
                work to be printed without consulting fact-checkers or editors. There are numerous
                small errors, such as the statement that Lee withdrew across the Potomac the evening
                after fighting ended at Antietam (a day too soon) and that after shooting Lincoln,
                Booth rode across a bridge over the Potomac to escape into Virginia (he actually
                rode over the Anacostia River into southern Maryland. And what are we to make of the
                following passage regarding a military organization entirely composed of black
                soldiers: "The Ninth Corps, whose regiments had been raised and trained in Maryland,
                was sent to join the Army of the Potomac in early March, 1864. It was the first
                black unit to march through Washington. On its way, one of its white officer
                recorded that, as it passed through Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 'we was stoned by the
                low people.' " Quite an itinerary - to march from Maryland to DC via Pittsburgh! And
                there are some simply bizarre observations, such as his comparison of McClellan with
                George Patton based on the fact that they were both handsome and came from
                well-to-do families. I'm sure Patton still hasn't stopped spinning in his grave!
                What saves this book from the lowest possible grade is that interspersed are
                genuinely interesting observations on the nature of the Civil War. He pays a great
                deal of attention to the impact of geography on strategy, he examines in some detail
                how the two sides were able to organize their armies from scratch and he explores
                what motivate the soldiers to fight under such appalling conditions.</d:para>

            <d:para>Every so often, I come back to Faulkner only to be left disappointed. I read
                    <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">As I Lay Dying</emphasis> in
                college, and <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">The Sound and the
                    Fury</emphasis> in the 1990's. As I Lay Dying was an interesting read, but my
                main recollection of the novel was a certain disdain for the uneducated,
                unintelligent characters. All I remember from the Sound and the Fury was the
                unintelligible first-person perspective of the character suffering from issues of
                mental development. Faulkner is a capable story teller but I find that something is
                off in his view of the world. It is as if he is walking through a landscape and pays
                only slight attention to the whole landscape because he is so focused on turning
                over rocks to see what creepy-crawlers lie underneath. It is natural to contrast
                Faulkner with other "southern" writers that I have read: Mark Twain in Huck Finn or
                Pudd'n Head Wilson, the stories of Flannery O'Connor, or Richard Wright's Native
                Son. Each of these other writers can be as unsparing in their sometimes scathing
                portrayals of the Jim Crow south. But Twain possessed an innate faith in the
                progress of human development, Wright had belief in communism and O'Connor her
                Catholic faith - each of these outlooks provided degree of hope that the south would
                evolve. Faulkner, on the other hand, seems only to offer a vision of stoic
                acceptance of a mean and harsh existence - an existence that can only be endured but
                not understood. And his characters are somehow too abstract, so that I am left with
                the impression that I am dealing solely with Faulkner's imagination rather that
                believable depictions of actual people. So I will set Faulkner aside yet again,
                perhaps never again to return.</d:para>

            <d:para>Subtitled: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making. An audio book from
                the library; I had read a review of this book in the Wall Street Journal. Mr. Fadell
                is an entrepreneur / technology executive whose accomplishments include managing the
                launch of the iPhone for Apple and the Nest programmable thermostat. I can't say his
                advice is unorthodox; the basic premise is that all you have to do is follow his
                example. And he goes to great length in providing detailed guidance on product
                development and running a technical company. So, if you want to become a CEO or
                corporate vice-president this book will probably be of use. For a software engineer,
                there is some useful information but not much.</d:para>

                but with more narrative content and less spouting a list of social science studies.
                The focus of this book, however, shifts from the value of a "tribal" culture in
                supporting an individual to an exploration of what the idea of freedom really means
                in the modern world.</d:para>

            <d:para>Uncle Steve sent this to me along with the Junger book. Mr. Bishop is a college
                professor from Canada who specializes in modern writer (such as Virginia Wolfe and
                James Joyce) and who happened to love riding his motorcycle. The book is somewhat of
                a mess in terms of organization, but he writes with an engaging and lightly
                self-deprecating style that held my interest. When he is writing about riding and
                road trips on his motorcycle the book is quite interesting. When he writes about his
                academic research and writing, I was not much interested. For instance, he was quite
                fascinated by book covers of the early editions of Joyce's Ulysses and by trying to
                identify who purchased the first 100 volumes of this work. Personally, I really
                don't care. But then again, I am happy to read about obscure details of Byzantine
                history, so to each his own. But I can see why Uncle Steve enjoyed the book,
                combining as it does a love of reading and a love of motorcycles.</d:para>

            <d:para>Dad recently read The Great Gatsby and said that he really enjoyed Fitzgerald's
                writing. He thought that his writing was almost poetic. I read the Great Gatsby in
                high school and wasn't much impressed, but in those days I read fiction in much the
                same manner as history; focusing on the plot and largely ignoring the style. So I
                picked up Tender is the Night at a used book store and decided to give Fitzgerald
                another chance. I must agree with Dad that his writing is very elegant and
                descriptive. He has a fine eye for detail that does a great job of setting a scene.
                He is also a master of dialogue. But I find his characters to be either shallow or
                not-believable or both. The two main characters of this book, Dick and Nicole Diver,
                are portrayed quite believably in their relationship. But their backgrounds are too
                perfectly fantastical. The enormously rich and beautiful socialite who is stricken,
                then recovers from, mental illness. And the middle class man who I supremely
                intelligent, charming and insightful. Much as modern tabloids portray the rich and
                the famous today, Fitzgerald seems to first create perfect characterizations so that
                he can slowly deconstruct the perfection. All of the supporting characters are
                uninteresting, and with hindsight, seem to be cliched images of the roaring-20's
                Americans in France. But knowing just a very little bit about Fitzgerald's troubled
                marriage and his wife's bouts with mental illness, I wonder how much of this book is
                autobiographical. I think a good contrast to this book is Tolstoy's Anna Karenina -
                that too is filled with upper-class characters of dubious morality, and a courtship
                and marriage that are somewhat autobiographical. The difference in the two works, in
                my opinion, is that Tolstoy's characters seem more real, more believable, less
                contrived.</d:para>

            <d:para>Stylistically, rather tough sledding. This book is composed of a set of lectures
                delivered at the University of Notre Dame, and the purpose of the lectures was to
                examine how history relates to philosophy (moral philosophy in general, Christian
                theology in particular). So, it would have been better titled "On the Catholic
                Philosophy of History." Following the lead of Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas, he
                holds that history, like all human activities, is directed towards a final end.
                Since modern society tends to ignore "final" ends (as defined by Aristotle) he
                offers thoughts on how Christians can continue to meaningfully study and contribute
                to historical knowledge without setting aside their belief in God and the future end
                of history in the coming of the Kingdom of God.</d:para>

            <d:para>An audio book from the library. A very interesting and though-provoking
                biography of General Edward Lansdale and the role he played in helping the
                government of the Philippines defeat a communist insurgency in the 1950's and his
                attempts to repeat this success in South Vietnam. Given the terribly poor
                performance of the bureaucrats in the State department and the careerist officers in
                the Department of Defense in understanding how to manage the crisis in Vietnam, Mr.
                Boot offers General Lansdale's approach as an alternative - the "road not taken" of
                the title. In his telling, Vietnam would have been best served by not treating what
                was primarily a political problem as a military problem. Sure, the South Vietnamese
                needed economic and military assistance, but they did not need for the US to take
                ownership of their issues. Perhaps South Vietnam would have fallen anyway, but it
                would have been at a far smaller cost in lost lives and lost credibility. One of the
                "losses" attributed to Lansdale is his leadership of Operation Mongoose - the
                Kennedy administration's hair-brained scheme to overthrow Castro. Lansdale was
                tapped to lead the effort because President Kennedy admired Lansdale but the CIA,
                State Dept. and the Department of Defense were adamantly opposed to him playing any
                role in shaping policy in South Vietnam. While Operation Mongoose clearly failed to
                unseat Castro, it also did not involve the US in a military conflict to achieve a
                political goal. More importantly, Mr. Boot can also point to later instances (El
                Salvador and Columbia) where a more advisory approach proved to be successful. Mr.
                Boot perhaps would have been better advised to have devoted less coverage to
                Landale's personal life, but I suspect that he was deliberately trying to "humanize"
                his subject to counter-act some of the wilder conspiracy theorists who use
                Lansdale's name in vain (looking at you, Oliver Stone.)</d:para>

                American history in the west, covering a period from Daniel Boone to the sod-busters

                Ohio River valley. But more particularly it is about the settling of the "upper
                Midwest," those states north of the Ohio River. The focus is really on the creation
                of the state of Ohio but in the end, the book really winds up being a history of the

            <d:para>From Dad's collection of presidential biographies that he accumulated in his
                project of reading the biography of each American president. While Fillmore is in
                some ways one of the most obscure Presidents, his political career was pretty
                interesting. Although nowadays Henry Clay is probably the most recognized figure in
                the Whig party, Fillmore was one of the of the major figures in that short-lived
                party. Interestingly, the Whigs never had a President who served a full term -
                William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor were both elected but died in office and
                Harrison's VP John Tyler was quickly rejected by the Whig party even while serving
                out his term. Fillmore, who served out the remainder of Taylor's term, was the most
                accomplished of the lot. Prof. Rayback portrays him a political moderate whose
                primary goal was to preserve the Union from sectional forces unleashed by the issue
                of slavery. But moderation in the "means" of politics does not equate to moderation
                in the "ends" - for while Fillmore professed to be personally opposed to slavery, he
                seemed quite content to preserve its existence if that was the price of avoiding
                conflict. As a result, his most notable political accomplishment - the Compromise of
                1850 did long survive his own electoral loss in 1852 and did little to prevent the
                civil war which broke out in 1860. And while he was a prime mover in the creation of
                the political organization that called itself the Whig party, the party itself was
                too divided by competing interests to long survive. And while Prof. Rayback tends to
                give him a pass as a coalition builder, Fillmore's involvement with such populist
                movements as the Anti-Masonic party and the anti-immigrant "Know Nothing" party do
                not reflect highly on his judgement.</d:para>

            <d:para>Stacy and I had given this to Thomas for Christmas a few years ago. We knew that
                it is a collection of stories about Orthodox Christians in contemporary Russia. What
                I learned upon reading it was that it provided both spiritual edification as well as
                a fascinating history of the Orthodox Church in the last years of the Soviet Union.
                While the history of the Russian Orthodox Church in the Soviet Union is a tragic
                one, Metropolitan Tikhon shows us that it was also a history of patient, courageous
                resistance that was not without its humorous moments.</d:para>

            <d:para>Thomas was assigned this book to read as an incoming freshman at Tufts;
                apparently Mr. Grann received a masters degree at the Fletcher School of
                International Relations at Tufts. This was an audio book from the library. This is a
                well researched and well written account of a series of murders of Osage Indians in
                Oklahoma in the early 1920's and how the predecessor of the FBI (directed by J.
                Edgar Hoover) claimed success in finding the culprits. There isn't much in American
                history that I find surprising, but the story of the Osage tribe is completely new
                to me. On one hand, they were driven to a reservation in Oklahoma like many tribes,
                on the other, they managed to choose (and buy) a location in northern Oklahoma that
                they assumed would be undesirable to any farmers. They had the foresight to obtain
                the mineral rights to the land they purchased, and the apparent good luck to find
                oil on their land. The tribe had the foresight to manage all the development rights
                to the oil fields, which brought in a substantial income to their tribe members. But
                the governments misguided (although probably well intentioned) effort to prevent
                members of the tribe from squandering their wealth produced a system of guardianship
                by which most of the tribe had their income managed by outsiders. This naturally
                produced corruption, exploitation, and worst of all, motivation for outright murder.
                It is sadly illuminating to discover anew just how depraved humans can be in
                advancing their own selfish interests at the expense of others. The only reason I
                rate this book a 3 rather than a 4 is the poor performance of the actors who read
                the book. The book has three sections, and each section has its own actor. The actor
                in the opening section was mildly annoying and the actor in the second was a joke -
                he read as if he were playing the part of grizzled detective in a 1940's film noire
                movie. </d:para>

            <d:para>An audiobook from the library. Interestingly, this book was first created as an
                audiobook rather than a printed book. One of the shortcomings of the book, in my
                opinion, is that it is over produced - too many annoying sound effects. On the other
                hand, it does allow Mr. Gladwell to include interview in the voice of the actual
                people involved. An Mr. Gladwell does a good job with his storytelling. Anyway, this
                is a well-balanced and thought provoking account of the proponents of "high
                altitude" precision bombing during WWII. These proponents are the "mafia" of the
                title. Unfortunately, with WWII technology, high altitude precision bombing was an
                oxymoron. As Mr. Gladwell notes, it wasn't until the 1990's that technology caught
                up with the vision. The most interesting discussion is on the morality of how a
                bombing campaign should be conducted. The bomber mafia were motivate by both the
                practical application and a moral imperative of selectively hitting high value
                targets with a minimum of casualties. The British, on the other hand, were
                proponents of night time area bombing (what we would call today "carpet bombing")
                aimed more at breaking the morale of their opponents than in degrading their war
                time economy. Gen Curtis LeMay, who took over the conduct of the strategic bombing
                of Japan took the middle road. When it was apparent that high level bombing simply
                wasn't effective, he adjusted to very low level bombing runs at night using
                incendiary bombs (napalm). His moral calculation was that the greater brutality of
                effect was more than offset by ending the war more quickly and thus preventing an
                even greater amount of future suffering. Mr. Gladwell is clear whose vision he
                prefers, but he is honest enough to present both sides of the argument. One final
                note, this is not the first book I've read by Mr. Gladwell - his strength is in
                asking a lot of questions, trying to evaluate complex issues in a new light and
                presenting his views in a compelling narrative. His biggest weakness, in my opinion,
                is that he gets too wrapped up in his own story and is prone to hyperbole and
                exaggeration. So, I had a quick laugh at his expense. At one point in this book, he
                wanted to really emphasize the importance of an observation and said something along
                the lines of "... given the risk of understatement ...". Based on my experience with
                Mr. Gladwell's writing, he positively has a phobia of understatement! None the less,
                this is a fine work.</d:para>

            <d:para>Although set in Russia just before the emancipation of the serfs in the 1860's,
                the subject matter is timeless. Two sons return from college educated in the latest

                ideology to his parents reared in the liberalism of the 1960's and 1970's. Turgenev
                is fair to both points of view but is not up to the task of making this a realistic

            <d:para>An audiobook from the library. After setting this aside for a few days, have
                decided to give up on this book for now. Normally, I would give a grade of 1 for
                this, but there are some redeeming qualities to Mr. O'Toole's writing that may
                prompt me to return to finish the book at a later date. First off, it is important
                to note the subtitle: A Personal History of Modern Ireland. This reveals the book's
                greatest shortcoming - treating Irish history as if it started with the author's own
                birth. Sure, he reflects on the impact of the 1916 rising, the struggle for
                independence and the Great Depression, but he holds he own experiences and those of
                his own family as the epitome of modern Irish culture. In some ways, this isn't a
                terrible choice. His observations and interests cover a wide range, and he is
                generally able to present multiple viewpoints on a given issue. On the other hand,
                we learn that as he grew up, he was the "fair-haired" child. For instance, when he
                was very young and his family visited his grandmother, his older brother his behind
                his mother while he ran and sat on his grandmother's lap. He relates that his
                grandmother warned that his older brother would come to no good. This is almost a
                throwaway detail, but I think it illustrates the author's self-regard. We learn that
                his essay was selected by his teacher as the best in his class, that he was chosen
                to sing the patriotic song at the school assembly, that he was chosen to be the
                choir boy when the Archbishop visited his parish, etc. So, I think he views himself
                as what an Irishman should be, and in this light, his title "We don't know
                ourselves" really means that the rest of you don't know yourselves, but I'm here to
                enlighten you. This is exacerbated by the fact that he accepts the current, European
                centered liberalism in which nationalism, religion and tradition are bad things to
                be discarded in order to achieve a "modern" European identity. His rejection of
                nationalism means that he can criticise the IRA and the British equally, that he can
                recognise the role of the Christian Brothers in educating the poor and middle
                classes of Ireland while unsparingly reporting on their abuses and short comings,
                etc. So, at times, he is quite thought-provoking on what aspects of culture should
                be carried forward as the world changes, and what should be cast aside. On the other
                hand, I would have to categorize him as a cynic when the term is uses in the sense
                of "a person who believes al people are motivated by selfishness." Ultimately he
                seems to believe that people are motivated by self-interest (specifically, material
                self-interest as measured by wealth and power) and they fool themselves when they
                think otherwise. So, in this regard, he views Pope John Paul II's visit to Ireland
                as a "reactionary" (his word) attempt to maintain the Church's grip on political
                power in Ireland, rather than as an evangelical to promote Christian values and warn
                against some of the darker aspects of modern secular culture. Perhaps because people
                haven't wholly embraced his own world-view, there is a sense of self-righteousness
                and anger in his criticisms. At times, he is so critical one wonders why anyone
                would chose to continue living in Ireland. Finally, I would suggest that for all his
                perception and learning, he himself doesn't know who he is (in the sense of
                Socrates' injunction to "know thyself.") He can reject tradition and authority out
                of hand because they don't hold society together the same way they did in his
                parents and grandparents generation. But he has accepted new sources of authority to
                which he seems blind - globalism, liberalism, sexual freedom, etc. And the
                authorities that he accepts without question have their own orthodoxies which he
                espouses with the fervor equal to that of the Christian Brothers who provided his
                education. Stylistically, aside from his acerbic tone, he is too wordy.  He seems to
                think that if one metaphore or simile will shed light on a topic, then a string of
                three or four in sucession will be even better. In summary, while he is something of
                a crank, he possesses the ability to make a somewhat dull topic interesting while
                stimulating thought about Ireland's place in the world.</d:para>

            <d:para>An audiobook from the library. Perhaps the history of the development of the
                index is not worthy of a whole book, but Mr. Duncan does an admirable job of making
                this an interesting history. For any student or reader of non-fiction, the index is
                a well-known if largely overlooked feature that is simply taken for granted. Mr.
                Duncan points out that in reality, it is something of an art in determining what to
                include and how it should be organized. This art, like all art, can be used
                sarcastically and several funny examples are provided. This, however, reveals one of
                the drawbacks of an audiobook. An index is a visual tool. When he provides an
                example of an index, the actor has to read each individual entry. While reading, the
                eye could quickly take in the same information that requires a minute or two of
                listening. </d:para>

            <d:para>An audiobook from the library. When I was a kid, there was a TV show called "The
                Gong Show." It was a talent show with three judges who would watch amateur
                performers and give a grade at the end of the performance. The twist to the show was
                that if one (or more) of the judges really did not like the performance, they could
                ring a large gong situated right behind their seats and the performance would be
                stopped early. Well, four chapters in to this book (read by the author,
                incidentally) Mr. Offerman gets my first ever Gong. Although I have only seen him in
                passing, Mr. Offerman is an actor and comedian; in addition I have read at least one
                interview with Mr. Offerman as an advocate for enjoying the outdoors. So when I read
                the description of this book and saw that it was inspired,  by the writings of
                Wendell Berry, I thought it might be interesting. But in four chapters (and an
                introduction) all that I have really come to learn is that Mr. Offerman really has
                nothing original or interesting to say. Sure, he has an ironic sense of humor, and
                when he sticks to humor the writing wasn't bad. But he is a big "name dropper,"
                listing his intereactions and friendships with other celebrities and bragging about
                that time he was invited to dinner with Wendell Berry. This dinner inspires him
                write a book and to take a wilderness trip with his friends to gather material for
                said. book. So, like a stereotypical air-headed Hollywood celebrity, he books a high
                end guided tour of Glacier National Park. As long as he is providing narrative of
                his trip, the book is somewhat entertaining. But mostly he veers off course on long
                rants about his political views. The sub-title to this book is "The Pastoral
                Observations of One Ignorant American Who Loves to Walk Outside." While Mr. Offerman
                is fond of acknowledging his own ignorance, what he is even more fond of explaining
                how most other Americans are the true ignoramuses. In four short chapters, he
                demonstrates a repeated propensity for listening to  one expert  and then reading a
                book or two and seeking validation from his circle of friends. Thus armed and
                deploying a knowing, sarcastic tone, he is  eager to instruct one and all on how
                things really work.  So instead of wasting any more time, I have banged the gong and
                Mr. Offerman's work disappears from the stage (in this case, my phone.) </d:para>

            <d:para>The last of the books from Anna's freshman Humanities Seminar. This book book is
                somewhat difficult to read. In part, due to the personal nature of St. Catherine's
                spiritual dialogue with God and in part due to the "stylistic" differences between a
                woman of the high Middle Ages and one raised and educated in a much different world.
                Rather than the compelling narrative of a more contemporary spiritual writer such as
                Thomas Merton, her reflections really demand that the reader slow down and
                concentrate. But that is the great advantage that a member of a religious order had
                over one fully engaged in the secular world. And in reading her description of those
                in her own day who struggle to follow the right path, people today are not much
                different.</d:para>

            <d:para>When I was a midshipman at the Naval Academy, the Division of English and
                History gave us a pamphlet of book recommendations that were felt to be beneficial
                for the professional development of Naval officers. I return to this from
                time-to-time to see if I have knocked any of the books off the list and to get ideas
                for further reading. Recently, I noticed this book and was able to find it on Google
                books. Here is the blur from the pamphlet describing the book: "If any single vessel
                were to be named as having the greatest impact on maritime history, one of the
                candidates would certainly be the Confederate raider <emphasis
                    xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="underline">Alabama</emphasis>.
                Semmes is also an eloquent spokesman for the Southern view of the Civil War."
                Another thing I will note, when I was a student, the academic studies of the
                American Civil War was largely dominated by southerners - the noted publishers were
                the University of Virginia, the University of North Carolina, and Louisiana State
                University. Given Semmes' unquestioning acceptance of the view that Africans were
                inherently inferior and actually benefited from slavery, I cannot imagine that a
                current edition of this pamphlet would include this book. His views on the issues of
                race were not solely confined to southerners, many in the north would have agreed
                with him as would many in Europe as well. And far from being an eloquent spokesman
                for the "southern view of the war," Semmes is an unsophisticated propagandist. It is
                my impression that his arguments are solely motivated by self-interest. He argues
                that Confederates are not traitors to their country because they have been the
                victims of oppression by the north, although he cannot provide any compelling
                evidence that this is the case. He simply ignores dissenting southern views (such as
                those of Andrew Jackson) and writes off northern criticism as either "Puritan"
                propaganda or economic self interest of Northerners. If a southerner chose to remain
                loyal to the United States, in his view it was done solely from the chance of
                receiving a promotion. Yet, by his own admission, he did not resign his own
                commission in the US Navy until he had been approached by the new Confederate
                government and offered a position.) Semmes also has a peculiarly self-interested
                sense of honor. He complains that the USS Kearsarge had wrapped anchor chain around
                its hull and therefore won a "dishonorable" fight with the Virginia, yet he had no
                compunction about flying the flag of another country to lull merchant ships into a
                false sense of security. And, in perhaps the most damning case, he accepted rescue
                from a British yacht as the Alabama was sinking while 11 members of his crew
                drowned. Semmes spends far more time trying to pin the responsibility for these
                deaths upon the commander of the Kearsarge than he does on the actual battle itself.
                Semmes is an example of the close-minded nature of southern leadership that sparked
                the civil war and lead to the Confederacy's quick demise. If Semmes (and by
                extension Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee) can only think that virtue lies on
                their own side and that the north is motivated solely by self- interest, how could
                they ever anticipate the lengths of endurance that the north was willing to accept
                in its effort to preserve the union? Semmes can never grasp the point that Lincoln's
                administration was willing to sacrifice the interests of the northern merchant fleet
                in order to bring all possible resources to bear on blockading the south. Semmes'
                impressive tally of ships burned did nothing to defeat the north. And while Semmes
                can note the effect that the northern blockade had on the south, he can't bring
                himself to question the wisdom (or lack thereof) of the southern strategy. All he
                can do is complain that the north had too many resources, the Yankees were too
                greedy, the British commercial class to self-interested, etc. So, my final judgement
                is that this book is best left to fade into obscurity. If you want a nuanced
                reflection on the southern perspective, turn to the memoirs of Sherman or
                Longstreet. If you want a primer on naval leadership as exhibited in the Civil War,
                turn to <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Incidents and
                    Anecdotes</emphasis> of the Civil War by David Dixon Porter or to Mahan's
