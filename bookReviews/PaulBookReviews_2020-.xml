                        <d:para>Have had this for a few years now; got half way through and now I’ve
                            decided to give up. Mr. Gardiner is a noted conductor of Bach’s choral
                            works and I own a couple of albums that he has conducted. But in spite
                            of his enthusiasm, he does not overcome the fundamental problem of
                            writing about another art form. For each cantata, he writes much more
                            than you get from the liner notes, but does not provide enough to allow
                            you to follow along as you listen to the cantata. It would have been
                            much better if he had done a series of lectures on a smaller selection
                            of cantatas. As a biographer of Bach, he provides a great deal of
                            insight on how he composed his works, but shows little understanding of
                            the culture / world view in which Bach operated. Mr. Gardiner is very
                            much a man of the modern secular world and projects his values onto Bach
                            more than truly trying to understand Bach. My recommendation - buy Mr.
                            Gardiner’s albums, but skip this book.</d:para>

                        <d:para>The subtitle, which sums up this book nicely, is: 'The Diary of a
                            Gulag Prison Guard 1935-1936. As you might expect, this is not an
                            uplifting book. Mr. Chistyakov was drafted into a position as a junior
                            officer supervision prison guards building railroads in the Soviet Far
                            East. A native of Moscow, Mr. Chistyakov was less than thrilled with his
                            new surroundings, and most of his diary is spent complaining about his
                            lot, thinking of ways to get out of his position and complaining about
                            his superiors. If the prisoners were at the very bottom rung of Gulag
                            society, the guards were barely one step above them (indeed, many guards
                            were former prisoners.) And depending on their skills and work tasking,
                            sometimes the prisoners had some leverage over their guards. While Mr.
                            Chistyakov remained a loyal Soviet, he was very critical of the Gulag.
                            Mr. Chistyakov's diary ends before we learn of his fate; apparently he
                            was arrested himself at some point. All that is known is that he was
                            killed at the front in 1941 fighting the Germans.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Thomas gave this book to me for Christmas; he attended a lecture my
                            Mr. Ross at Tufts University and bought the book afterwards. These days,
                            the phrase "Peace in the Middle East" is synonymous with "a hopeless
                            task." Nobody has tilted at this windmill harder than Mr. Ross, and I
                            say that not in disparagement but to illustrate the depth of his
                            background in this subject. In summary, the authors believe that the
                            only hope for peace is for the creation of separate states and that
                            given the continued bad faith and judgement of Palestinian leadership,
                            the only way for this to occur is for Israel to impose the boundaries
                            themselves. But before presenting his recommendations, they examine the
                            careers of four Israeli prime ministers (Ben-Gurion, Begin, Rabin, and
                            Sharon. Each of these prime ministers had to make a decision that
                            balanced Israel's need for security while advancing the possibility of
                            achieving peace - most famously by Begin and Sadat at Camp David. This
                            book is well written, well reasoned and gives honest attention to
                            viewpoints that differ from the authors'. </d:para>

                        <d:para>Revised edition. I started this several years ago, and finally got
                            around to finishing it. Central premise is to explore the difference
                            between investment and speculation and to offer guidance to those who
                            wish to invest intelligently rather than simply gamble with their money.
                            Asks the reader to evaluate their interest in the process of
                            understanding investments and to assess their goals. If nothing else,
                            this helped me to recognize that I am curious about how money can be put
                            to effective use, but my level of interest does not rise above simple
                            curiosity. Which, I suppose, is why I am a software engineer and not a

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para>A well written and well balanced biography. President McKinley, was
                            a man of even temperament, quiet confidence and low key charisma. He had
                            the bad luck not only of being assassinated but of being followed in
                            office by the hyper-energetic and highly charismatic Teddy Roosevelt.
                            Despite being overlooked for many years, he may rank as one of the most
                            effective presidents in terms of using his executive powers in
                            coordination with his party's operations in the legislature. I find it
                            interesting that Mr. Merry, who also wrote A Country of Vast Designs
                            about President Polk, has chosen to write about two presidents who are
                            relatively unknown despite a tremendous amount of success in office.
                            Both served during periods of tremendous expansion of American power
                            (and geography) and both seem to be ethereally regarded as accidental
                            by-standers to these monumental events. But Mr. Merry make a compelling
                            case that they actually were shaping events through a quiet brand of
                            leadership in coordination with effective behind-the-scenes political
                            operations. Mr. Merry does not seem to advance any particular ideology
                            in these two biographies. He balances praise with criticism and presents
                            his subjects' point of view as well as those of their respective
                            opponents. In particular, I was struck by two observations by Mr. Merry.
                            Pres.. Polk was an opponent of tariffs, and one of his first actions was
                            to pass legislation to greatly reduce them. The apparent result was a
                            great increase in government revenue - despite lower taxes, economic
                            expansion produce greater government revenue. So great, that the US paid
                            the costs of military action in the Mexican War without incurring debt.
                            Pres. McKinley was a great believer in tariffs, and one of his earliest
                            actions was to raise tariffs. The apparent result was a great increase
                            in government revenue, this time due to higher taxes and increasing
                            economic activity. So great an increase as to finance the
                            Spanish-American War (as well as the subsequent fighting against
                            insurgents in the Philippines) with the addition of a short-term tax on
                            beer and other consumer items. Mr. Merry does not make this comparison -
                            indeed he seems little interested in economic details - but it shows
                            that he does not appear to apply modern political outlooks to his
                            historical analysis. For a present day Republican would be greatly in
                            favor of the Democratic Polk's policy of lowering taxes while a present
                            day Democrat would much prefer the Republican McKinley's approach of
                            raising taxes.</d:para>

                        <d:para>A very interesting novel. Solovyov is a graduate student in history
                            whose thesis is on General Larionov. On one level, the novel seems to be
                            a very satirical take on Russian academia. Even given the difficulties
                            of translation (for instance, in Russian, the novel apparently included
                            hundreds of footnotes, but the translator opted to include them in the
                            text), the novel is amusing. Then there are the details of Solovyov's
                            upbringing in a remote railway town and his romantic interests. These
                            descriptions begin with the same sense of ironic detachment, but
                            gradually these topics take on greater depth. And finally, there is the
                            life of General Larionov, who commanded the White army's last stand
                            against the Bolsheviks in the Crimea, yet who somehow escaped execution
                            and died a natural death of old age in the Soviet Union. Whenever
                            Solovyov's research turns up new details on the general, the story jumps
                            back in time. The general remains a rather two dimensional character in
                            the novel and much of his concern seems to be trying to understand the
                            boundary between life and death and to understand his relationships with
                            those who have died before him and those who still live. The novel
                            concludes in a rather dramatic fashion in which a number of seemingly
                            innocuous details described earlier in the novel are linked in the
                            General's confrontation with the Bolshevik forces as they occupy Yalta.
                            I plan to read this novel again someday, if for no other reason than to
                            see how many more details tie to the conclusion. But also, Mr.
                            Vodolazkin seems to be attempting a larger examination on the process of
                            recording and understanding history versus living and understanding life
                            in the first place.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Audio Book, I checked this out before driving up to Boston to pick
                            Thomas up from Tufts University due to the school closure as a result of
                            the coronovirus outbreak. The autobiography of Chris Kyle, a Nay SEAL
                            who completed 4 combat tours in Iraq. He served as a sniper and is
                            credited with more confirmed kills than any sniper in American history.
                            Mr. Kyle seemed to be one of those individuals who are drawn to the
                            experience of combat. Not in the somewhat theatrical style of say,
                            General Patton, but in the manner of someone who takes pride in doing a
                            very difficult job and doing it very well. Mr. Kyle was not of a
                            philosophical or intellectual inclination, and his story is told with
                            great enthusiasm. What I think is the best touch with this book was the
                            fact that they included, in the first person, the perspective of his
                            wife as she dealt with the challenges of being married to a SEAL in a
                            time of war. In a sad bit of irony (not dealt with in this book), Mr.
                            Kyle was murdered by a fellow veteran a number of years after the war.

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para>I've been slowly working on this for a few years now. It is amusing
                            that this is entitled as an "Introduction" as this is written at a far
                            higher level than that which most people would consider introductory. I
                            believe that it is intended as an introduction for graduate level
                            students of philosophy and theology and probably professors in these
                            fields who do not have a Christian background. The structure is straight
                            forward, but the writing is often dense. So, I plowed through some
                            sections with glazed eyes, yet found other sections to be very engaging
                            and thought provoking. Fortunately, the concluding paragraph give a very
                            clear summary of the book. I quote the conclusion in the next
                            paragraph.</d:para>
                        <d:para>"The goal of the Christian is not private bliss but the whole. He
                            believes in Christ, and for that reason he believes in the future of the
                            world, not just in his own future. He knows that this future is more
                            than he himself can create. He knows that there is a meaning he is quite
                            incapable of destroying. Is he therefore to sit quietly with his hands
                            in his lap? On the contrary; because he knows there is such a thing as
                            meaning, he can and must cheerfully and intrepidly do the work of
                            history, even though from his little segment of it he will have the
                            feeling that it is a labor of Sisyphus and that the stone of human
                            destiny is rolled anew, generation after generation, up the hill only to
                            roll down again once more and nullify all previous efforts. Whoever
                            believes knows that things move “ forward ”, not in a circle. Whoever
                            believes knows that history is not like Penelope’s tapestry, which was
                            always being woven anew only to be undone again. Even the Christian may
                            be assailed by the nightmares, induced by the fear of fruitlessness, out
                            of which the pre - Christian world created these moving images of the
                            anxiety that all human activity is vain. But his nightmare is pierced by
                            the saving, transforming voice of reality: “ Be of good cheer, I have
                            overcome the world ” ( Jn 16: 33 ). The new world, with the description
                            of which, in the image of the final Jerusalem, the Bible ends, is no
                            Utopia but certainty, which we advance to meet in faith. A salvation of
                            the world does exist — that is the confidence that supports the
                            Christian and that still makes it rewarding even today to be a
                            Christian"</d:para>

                        <d:para>A free version of this from Amazon Kindle. This is not a book to
                            read straight through, but rather a collection of contemplations by a
                            monk. Perhaps because of the translation, the language is archaic. While
                            this sometimes works to "elevate" the text, in this case, it often made
                            it hard to retain focus on some passages.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Finished this on Easter Day, 2020, in the year of the coronovirus
                            pandemic. I can't remember where I first heard about this book;
                            certainly almost no-one today would think that Mark Twain would have
                            written a favorable portrayal of Joan of Arc. When I was young, I had
                            read A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which displayed
                            Twain's biting satire, confidence in modern progress in comparison to
                            medieval ignorance and superstition. So I turned to the internet to get
                            the reaction of others to this book. Susan Harris, a professor states:
                            "By the time Twain is writing <emphasis
                                xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="italic"
                                >Recollections</emphasis>, he’s not a believer. He is anti-Catholic,
                            and he doesn’t like the French. So he writes a book about a
                            French-Catholic-martyr? Ostensibly, it doesn’t make a lot of sense."
                            Most modern opinions cited on Wikipedia, unless they are from profession
                            Catholics, either share this befuddlement or our downright dismissive.
                            Yet this is what Mark Twain had to say: "I like <emphasis
                                xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="italic">Joan of
                                Arc</emphasis> best of all my books; and it is the best; I know it
                            perfectly well. And besides, it furnished me seven times the pleasure
                            afforded me by any of the others; twelve years of preparation, and two
                            years of writing. The others needed no preparation and got none." A
                            newspaper review (cited by his daughter) at the time of publication sums
                            up this work with: "His language has undergone a startling change. Not
                            flippancy, but pathos, meets us on every page; the sardonic mocking
                            spirit has been conquered by the fair Maid of Orleans, and where
                            aforetime we met laughter, we now meet tears." Personally, I loved this
                            book. There are some drawbacks. The ongoing interactions between Noel
                            and the Paladin is annoying and distracting - I times I would skip over
                            sections relating between the two. But as a reflection on the life of
                            Joan and her impact upon French history, this is a masterful work of
                            historical fiction.</d:para>

                        <d:para>When it comes to book titles, ususally I complain about inane
                            sub-titles. In this case, the sub-title actually tells you the theme of
                            the book. Silly me for thinking this would be a naval history. The
                            actuall H.M.S. Dreadnaught does not make its first appearance until page
                            461, and then the ship gets a whole chapter describing its construction
                            and technical innovations. And, since the name of the ship is used to
                            descirbe all of the battleships built by Britain from 1904 until WWI,
                            there are additional mentions of "dreadnaughts" in the remaining 447
                            pages of the book. And there is a second volume - Castles of Steel - to
                            follow. But I digress. Mr. Massie provides a detailed examination of the
                            political, economic and military relations between Germany and Great
                            Britain between the unification of Germany until the outbreak of WWI.
                            Since Britain was historically antagonistic with France, and
                            periodically with Russia, it was by no means inevitable that Britain
                            would have sided with France and Russia in the decade before WWI. An
                            implied thesis for why this was so is Kaiser Wilhelm II's insistance on
                            building a powerful fleet. In the end, I can't help but think that
                            Germany and Great Britain, as the two most powerful nations in Eurpope,
                            badly played their hands. Bismark's sole policy following the
                            unification of Germany was to prevent a combination of more than two
                            powers (the powers of his time being Britain, France, Austria and
                            Russia) uniting against Germany. Wilhelm II's blind adherence to an
                            alliance with Austria alienated Russia. His insistance on a powerful
                            navy alienated Great Britain. Great Britain, under Lord Salisbury, was
                            content to avoid involvement in continental squabbles while maintaining
                            superiority at sea. The Liberal cabinet that came to power in 1906
                            managed to improve ties with France, in part to prevent further friction
                            from competing colonial endeavors. This certainly served Great Britain's
                            interests. But the involvment of the British Army staff in coordinating
                            potential operations was naive. The French, weaker than Germany, had
                            every interest in drawing Britain into an alliance. Britain, aside from
                            assuring a hostile power did not appear in Belgium and the Netherlands,
                            had no inherent interest in supporting the French army against the
                            Germans. In the end, the weak powers dragged the strong into global
                            conflict.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Anna read this last summer as part of her summer reading for
                            English. It details the total breakdown of social order caused by a
                            pandemic of sudden blindness. In the part of the book set when the
                            charaters are forced into quarantine, the story is like a very condensed
                            version of the Gulag Archipeligo. Aside from the narrative of social
                            chaos, the interactions of the characters allow Mr. Saramago to reflect
                            on physical blindness vs. moral blindness. Perhaps the most interesting
                            feature of this story is that it is filled with colloquialisms. The most
                            annoying feature of this novel is the rendering of dialog. Extended
                            dialog tends to run in single paragraphs with no delination of the
                            speaker and often no puntuation between statements.</d:para>

                        <d:para>David Bentley Hart once published a long list of books that he
                            recommended and this was one of them. I was not really impressed. On one
                            hand, the main character's journey to Italy in the mid 1930's is fairly
                            interesting. Despite the fine writing, I really did not like any of the
                            characters. Nor did I relate to their emotional turmoil In a way it
                            reminds me of Death in Venice. Both books struck me as having an
                            overblown, morbid fixation on death. Not death as it relates to the
                            human condition, but with an individual's fixation on their own death.
                            Mr. Szerb might argue, as does one of his characters, that modern
                            civilization has distracted us to such a degree that we simply forget
                            about death. </d:para>

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para>An examination of two "intelligence failures - the failure to
                            predict the Iranin Revolution in 1979 and the mistaken belief that Iraq
                            had weapons of mass destruction prior to the second Gulf War. Mr. Jervis
                            does have a number of recommendations for improving the process of
                            analysis of intelligence; in particular by adopting more rigorous
                            methodologies from social science and academia. (To which the cynic will
                            reply - but of course he would recommend that because that is his
                            background!) But Mr. Jervis is a very thoughtful and balanced critic. He
                            does not argue that the Intelligence Community (IC) should be able to
                            predict the future. And in the case of Iraqi WMD, he aruges that based
                            on what they know, the IC wasn't out of line to predict that Iraq had
                            them - indeed the intel agencies of all the countries involved and the
                            media all believed the same thing at the time. His criticism is that the
                            IC should have noted that the actual degree of uncertainty with its
                            intel and should have considered ways in which it could have challenged
                            its assumptions. Mr. Jervis also points out the intelligence is not
                            policy, and those who make policy don't always want better intelligence.
                            Elected officials (and even bureaucrats) tend to have pre-conceived
                            notions of what they want based upon their political leanings / world
                            view, and better intelligence that runs counter to their belief will not
                            be welcome. Indeed, he suggests that policy makers like using the IC's
                            mistakes so that politicians can use the IC as a scapegoat.
                            Stylistically, this is a dry and academic treatement of the subject, but
                            Mr. Jervis offers a model of clear, rational evaluation of evidence. He
                            takes examples of failures from each administration from Roosevelt thru
                            George W. Bush (except for maybe Truman) and from other nations as well.
                            Nor does he adaopt polemical language to make his points. And there is
                            the occasional humor: "We are not happy with the apocryphal story of a
                            British Foreign Office official who proudly said on his retirement that
                            throughout his career he had said there would be no European war and was
                            wrong only twice"!</d:para>

                        <d:para>A fairly balanced history of Greece since its independence from the
                            Ottomans. The idea that Greece needs a biography instead of a history is
                            somewhat of a conceit of the author; based upon his history, if Greece
                            were a person, it would be a person suffering from manic-depression or
                            split personality. I in no way intend this as a crticism of Greece or
                            the Greeks, but to poke fun at the author's pretensions. But Mr. Beaton
                            does a commendable job of detailing the challenges that the Greeks have
                            had in creating an independent, stable, prospersous country. He
                            describes the long standing tensions between tradition and modernitiy,
                            between east and west, between religious and ethic identity, between
                            democracy and dictatorship. A useful study that probably shed some light
                            on what much of the Balkans have in store as they deal with the histor
                            of opression by the Ottoman's and the Soviets.</d:para>

                        <d:para>After 30 years of English &amp; German royal and parliamentary
                            politics with some naval development thrown in on the side in
                            Dreadnaught, the payoff comes with the history of the war at sea in WWI.
                            Which, as far as battleships go, pretty comes down to the Battle of
                            Jutland. I am already familiar with that battle, and Mr. Massie does a
                            fine job of describing the action and evaluating the performance of the
                            participating admirals and ships (as he does with all the engagements in
                            this book.) He gives a great deal of Adm. Jellico, who is usually
                            criticised for excessive criticism. But his handling of the British
                            Grand Fleet ensured a devestating blockade of Germany, and his tactics
                            at Jutland ensured the German High Seas Fleet would not win. Mr. Massie
                            also gives a lot of attention to Churchill's performance running the
                            Admiralty, the Gallipoli campaign and the evolution of German submarine
                            warfare. A few observations about naval warfare in WWI. Just like with
                            the armies on land, technology had evolved to allow the projection of
                            tremendous fire power over very long distances. Strategically,
                            communication technology allowed the fleet to stay in close contact and
                            coordination with headquarters. But tactically, the newness of wireless
                            communiation combined with no technology to improve navigation
                            considering the high speeds of modern ships meant that both the British
                            and the Germans often missed out on great success (the Germans at the
                            Battle of the Falklands and the British at Jutland). And, one can't help
                            but conclude that the world lost its collective mind in August 1914. The
                            stunning amount of casualties inflicted in pursuit of such paltry goals.
                            Also, interesting to reflect on the naval competition between Britain
                            and Germany in light of the current tensions between the U.S. and
                            China.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Pevear &amp; Volokhonsky translation, which is highly commended
                            online. This book had an insert indicating that it was an Oprah Winfrey
                            book club recommendation - kudos to Oprah for this recommendation,
                            although I wonder how many people bought the book only to discover this
                            edition is 817 pages long! This book has sat in my collection for some
                            time now as I had developed somewhat of a negative view of Tolstoy. Not
                            exactly sure why, but some of the short stories of his had struck me as
                            overly moralistic and perhaps self-righteous. But I was deeply impressed
                            with this novel. First of all, the plot summary that I was familiar with
                            was that this was the story the "fall" of a high society women who
                            leaves her husband. While that is technically true, and while Anna
                            Karennina's emotional struggle is the main driver of the story, you
                            could make the argument that she is not the main character in this
                            novel. I would argue that Konstantin Levin is actually the main
                            character, and that the novel might more accurately been titled "Love
                            and Marriage" (cue the Frank Sinatra song …) Tolstoy offers in depth
                            examination of love, marriage and faith and the various ways these
                            played out in upper crust Russian society in the 1870's. The novel is
                            brialliantly written and I truly enjoyed it. I didn't rank it as a 5
                            because I doubt I'd read the whole thing again, although I might return
                            to the final section.</d:para>

                            enjoyed The Big Sky, but this one, not so much. This book was either
                            from Grandpa Krush's collection, or maybe Grandpa Rodine's; but since

                        <d:para>I inherited this book from Grandpa Rodine. Since there is no cover
                            jacket, I assumed it was a history of the "War of Jenkins' Ear" (more
                            generally referred to as the War of Austrian Succession." Instead, this
                            is a work of historical fiction, set at the start of the Seven Years War
                            with characters relating their experience in the War of Jenkins Ear. The
                            stories are very well done. The plot device that drives the telling of
                            the stories is far less interesting (and far too wordy.) The authors
                            clearly enjoyed the process of getting "inside" their characters. But in
                            the end, the plot is not convincing, the dialog is too wordy and whole
                            effect falls short.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Inherited from the library of my grandfather - Thaddeus Krush.
                            Originally published in 1938, the style is dated. For instance, when
                            referring to the American people, he often says "we," where today
                            historians would strive to view their subject with an outsiders
                            perspective. And in 2020, could you imagine anyone writing the following
                            senentce: "General Jackson was an ideal slave-owner." p349 - and
                            surviving the Twitter storm that would follow? But for all the stylistic
                            challenges, the book is well researched and won a Pulitzer Prize. Mr.
                            James provices ample footnotes and includes frequent quotations from
                            letters and speeches of Jackson, his friends and his foes.</d:para>
                        <d:para>Mr. Marquis portrays Jackson as the paragon of the Scots-Irish
                            "Border Chieftan". Proud and honest to a fault, devoted to his family
                            and friends and implacable to his foes. His central political tenet was
                            the preservation of the United States and service to the common people
                            (as Jackson understood the needs of the people.) Mr. James view Jackso
                            mostly as a conservative"The contest of 1824 … witnessed the opening of
                            the schisms that were to wreck the Republican Party and remould it,
                            Andrew Jackson's violent moderation sueperseding the mild radicalism of
                            Thomas Jefferson …"p364. "The gradual alteration from border
                            conservative to national liberal is noteworthy …" p721 , but one whose
                            views adjusted to his perception of what was best for the union. </d:para>
                        <d:para>I would probably rate Jackson as the most interesting person in the
                            first half of the 1800's, and this book does a good job of capturing the
                            drive and energy of one who never sought popularity yet became the most
                            popular American of his era. And Mr. James does a very good job of
                            balancing this with the details of his personal life. Mr. James clearly
                            views slavery as a great wrong and he notes the hypocrosy in the
                            southern attempts to soften the image of slavery by referring to it as
                            the "peculiar institution" and to the slaves as "servants." But he does
                            not belabor the details of Jackson's brief venture as a slave trader,
                            and he treats Jackson's benevolent handling of his slaves as a positive
                            indication of the quality of Jackson's character. The chattering classes
                            of today, in their correct (but self-righetous) condemnation of the
                            bitter fruit that slavery has born in our country, would brand him a
                            simple bigot and consign him to oblivion. The same holds true for Mr.
                            James' handling of Jackson's relations with Native Americans. Indeed,
                            perhaps the greatest shortcoming of this book is the complete ignoring
                            of the Trail of Tears. </d:para>
                        <d:para>Two weeks ago, a mob attempted to pull down the statue of Jackson in
                            front of the White House. In part, this is what makes Jackson so
                            interesting. He did not create the society in which he lived and he was
                            not one to question the pros and cons of the social order that he
                            inherited. For that, he deserves no credit and clearly falls short of
                            the standard of a "great" man. Yet, if Jackson had joined Burr in a
                            successful attempt to create an independent nation along the
                            Mississippi, or not defeated the British at New Orleans and prevented
                            them from returning Louisiana to Spain or not held the Union together
                            during the South Carolina nullification crisis, doesn't it seem probable
                            that slavery would have endured much longer in a long running civil war
                            between different sections of are now the U.S.? And his personal
                            popularity was key in pullilng the process of selecting Presidential
                            candidate from the hands of state Congressional delegations and thus to
                            bolstered American democratic traditions. And as determined a military
                            foe of the Native American as Jackson was, during the campaign against
                            the Creeks, he adopted an orphaned Creek boywhen no Creek woman would do
                            so and raised him as his own child. </d:para>

                        <d:para>Thomas read this for a history course this summer; I read it given
                            the current COVID-19 pandemic. First off, let's dispense with the review
                            of Ms. Spinney's writing style. The book's sub-title with its hackneyed
                            "how it changed the world" sets a bad first impression. Given the scope
                            the subject, Ms. Spinney is upfront about organizing her book more as a
                            collection of narratives rather that a strict chronological layout. I am
                            fine with that approach, but there are times when the structure of her
                            paragraphs simply do not make sense. For instance, there is one
                            paragraph that begins with a sentence describing the impact of the
                            "Spanish Flu" on pregnant women. The next sentence states that many
                            people bled from the nose and mouth and the rest of the sentence deals
                            with the experience of soldiers on troop transports. There is a section
                            in one chapter that focuses on the flu in Chile that concludes with a
                            single paragraph on the Shanshi province in China. Then the chapter
                            breaks to a new section examing the flu in Shanshi. Why the orphan
                            paragraph in the previous section? She is prone to run-on sentence and
                            sentences in which two clauses don't really belong together. She
                            sometimes uses words out of contex - Chilean Lieutenant Dagoberto Godoy
                            is an "ace pilot" because he flew a plane over the Andes (his Wikipedia
                            bio indicates that he never served in time of war, and thus never shot
                            down the requisite 5 enemy planes to be classified as an "ace".) And
                            there is the sentence in which she states that "By 1918 [Poland] had
                            been entirely erase from the map..." The Polish partition was complete
                            in 1795- certainly "by 1918" but her syntax would imply the partition
                            had only been recently completed. I hold the editor and the
                            fact-checkers from her publish (Public Affairs, New York) most
                            responsible for allowing so many annoying little errors.</d:para>
                        <d:para>Issues of stye aside, Ms. Spinney's coverage of the scientific
                            efforts to understand that the flu is top notch. Her coverage of the
                            public policy actions taken to try to manage impact of the pandemic are
                            also well done. It is clear from her writing that she is not a fan of
                            "traditional" societies, institutions and social structures, but she is
                            fair in pointing out where the "traditionalists" played a helpful role.
                            And while he symphaties clearly lie with the "scientific" mindset, she
                            is honest about the short comings of those who try to practice the
                            "scientific method" as well. What I found most interesting in her
                            account is how slowly "human nature" changes and indeed how slowly
                            scientific knowledge advances. In 1918-19, it was not known that the flu
                            was caused by a virus (or even that such a thing a virus existed). Those
                            socieiteis that best weathered the flu were those that practiced the
                            time-honored practices of social distancing and quarantine. Today, we
                            know much more about the virus that causes COVID-19, but we still have a
                            very limited knowledge of the exact mechanics of how it spreads. Yet the
                            most effective reponse still seems to be social distancing and
                            quarantine of those deemed to be at high-risk. But in 1918 as in 2020,
                            the interactions between politicians, bureaucrats and scientist seems to
                            have improved very little.</d:para>

                            weaves the viewpoints of many of the participants into his narrative. It
                            is very easy to criticize the initial performance of the U.S. Army in
                            combat and this book amply proves the wisdom of the adage "the more you
                            sweat in training, the less you bleed in combat." But this book also
                            illustrates just how quickly the Americans learned how to
                            fight.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Bought this for Anna recently as she has been a fan of Steph Curry
                            and the Golden State Warriors. This is not a well written book. It is
                            ramblin, dis-organized and offers very little insight on what made the
                            Warriors so good. Mostly it is a rehashing of Kevin Durant's tenure with
                            the Warriors and Mr. Strauss' long running fued with Mr. Durant. Mr.
                            Strauss portrays Mr. Durant as an insecure super-star, yet Mr. Strauss
                            comes across as equally insecure. Indeed, Mr. Strauss inserts himself
                            into the book far too often. If the book were intended to portray life
                            as a reporter covering a great team, that would have been fine. Another
                            instance where good editorial guidance could have greatly improved the
                            book. Mr. Strauss presens some some interesting views, but it in the end
                            it is not a compelling treatment of its subject.</d:para>

                        <d:para>A relatively brief treatment of one of the seven deadly sins;
                            written as part of a collecition covering all seven. Each chapter is, in
                            effect, an essay on an aspect of envy. And, as usual, Mr. Epstein brings
                            his tremdous learning to bear upon the subject and writes with style,
                            charm and wit. I laughed out loud about five or six times while reading
                            this book. For instance, he writes a chapter dealing with the envy the
                            old hold for youth - he titled the chapter: "The Young, God Damn Them."
                            Or this example of understated irony: "The rich want to be beautiful or
                            wish themselves wise; and the wise, if they really are wise, know that
                            the wisdom begins with the acknowledgement that one knows nothing, so,
                            really, what the hell good is that." Looking at these two examples, I
                            realize that they do not do Mr. Epstein justice. The chapter title,
                            removed from the context of the book, make him seem like an angry crank.
                            And the quote could imply that he has no respect for wisdom. </d:para>

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para>Reminded me a bit of "Crime and Punishment", where the author
                            portrays the innner struggle of a young man who has committed murder.
                            But while the structure of the novels are similar, the "outlook" of the
                            novels differ greatly. Mr. Wright is just as effective as Dostoeyevsky
                            in taking the reader inside the head of one consumed by the commission
                            of murder and attempts to avoid capture in the aftermath. Unfortunately,
                            once the story moves into the court house, Native Son devolves into a
                            series of long speeches about the deplorable social conditions faced by
                            African Americans. These ruminations are worth reading, but would have
                            been better as an essay. The end effect is similar to Sinclair's "The
                            Jungle," where a gripping story devolves into a political tract. Mr.
                            Wright was a member of the Communist Party for a while, and this seems
                            apparent in the final section of the novel. But, not knowing much of his
                            biography, and just inferring from what I read in "Native Son", his
                            Communism is unrecgonizable when contrasted to that of the Bolsheviks.
                            It seems most concerned with support for organized labor and for racial
                            equality. And while American communism never achieved lasting influence
                            and International communism has ignomiously crumbled, in hindsight it
                            must be said that on the issue of racial equality the American
                            communists were correct. It is a shame that the loathing the average
                            American bore the communists probably served to discredity racial
                            equality once it was espoused by the communists. Yet in this instance,
                            the communists deserve some credity, while the Democratic Party bears
                            the shame of enabling "Jim Crow" and the Republican Party (in the 20th
                            century) that of genrally ignoring the issue altoghether. Issues of
                            artistic style aside, this remains a compelling novel.</d:para>

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para>I bought this book for Thomas due to his great interest in his high
                            school World History course. Mr. Frankopan rightly notes the traditional
                            historical emphasis on the rise and triumph of the West. This book puts
                            the spotlight on the history and influence (religious, cultural and
                            economic) of south and central Asia. Until his coverage reaches the 20th
                            century, I felt he was reasonablly balanced and did a great job of
                            covering event that are unfamiliar to most in the West. For all his
                            enthusiasm for his subject, there are some flaws in his outlook. Mr.
                            Frankopan seems to feel that in order to boost the profile of the Silk
                            Road region, he must denigrate the West. For instance, if the Monguls
                            destroyed certain cities to intimidate those they will encounter later,
                            he notes that for their historical reputation for savagery, they were
                            pragmatically asserting their authority over the regions they were
                            conquering (and, in total, preserving the great wealth they were
                            ruling). He does not give the Crusaders, or the British or the Americans
                            any such benefit of the doubt. Indeed, if America had followed the
                            conventions of the Monguls, we would have dropped nuclear bombs on
                            Baghdad, Tehran and Kabul in the aftermath of 9/11. And he states: "The
                            great iron, then, that although Eurpoe experienced a glorious Golden
                            age, … it was forged by violence." True, but how does that differ from
                            the Persian Empire, or Alexander and the Hellenic empire, or the Roman
                            Empire, or the Byzantines, or the Islamic caliphates, or the Mongol and
                            Ottoman Empires - each of which established it hegemony over central
                            Asia by force?</d:para>
                        <d:para>This leads us to the 20th and 21st Centuries, which receive as much
                            coverage as all of the ages past. He criticizes the European powers from
                            asserting their economic and political interests. By implication, this
                            is a bad thing, even though, based on the evidence presented in his
                            history, they were no worse than those who proceeded them. In the end,
                            he is product of post-WWII western education that believes in human
                            rights, the rule of law, democracy and intellectual development, as
                            practiced in the West. When the West fails to live up to his ideals, he
                            is quick to criticize. And that would be a fine approach to take, if you
                            also held the Soviets, the Chinese and the Indians to the same standard.
                            He accruately notes the wide ranging attempts by the Soviets to reshape
                            the region to its own purposes, yet this is done without censure. And he
                            treats American involvement in the Middle East as tragic. Certainly, it
                            has been so for the Middle East. But unlike the British, the US (to
                            date) has bankrupted itself in defense of a colonial empire. The US has
                            failed to remake the Middle East in the image idealized by the West, yet
                            the US has enough population and natural resource on its own to fall as
                            far as the British did in the 20th Century. Mr. Frankopan believes the
                            center of the world sits in Central Asia, which makes him largely blind
                            to North and South America and Africa (even Egypt generally gets short
                            shrift.) </d:para>
                        <d:para>There are a couple of minor nitpicks I have with regards to his
                            coverage of the Crusades. He critized the eventual focus of the Crusades
                            on the capture of Egypt due to a simply desire for plunder and wealth.
                            That is certainly partially true, but from a strategic point of view,
                            whoever controls Egypt controls Jerusalem. It is no accident that
                            Salahdin, who captured Jerusalem from the Crusade state had first
                            established his rule over Egypt. (And note, that even today, the US
                            provides enormous amounts of aid to Egypt in order to preseve peace
                            between Egypt and Israel.)</d:para>
                        <d:para>Aside from my substantial criticisms, this is still a worthwhile
                            book. Mr. Frankopan writes well, and in his enthusiasm does remind us
                            that there is much to learn from outside our own culture.</d:para>

                            book is how to live to achieve happiness. In modern usage, happiness is
                            a feeling - think of the yellow smiley face figure. But for Aristotle,
                            happiness is not a feeling, but the achievement of the higest possible
                            goodness. Good is another word that differs greatly from Aritotle's
                            meaning and common usage today.</d:para>

                        <d:para>An interesting overview of the attempt by some scientist to assert a
                            scientific theory of morality. In some sense this is understandable
                            given the endless conflict and controversy that continue in spite of the
                            best efforts of philosphers and theologians to develop a universal
                            standard of morality. But the authors point out that over 200 years of
                            scientific efforts have done no better. Worse, some scientists, in order
                            to make their hypothosesis fit their facts, seem to have concluded that
                            there is no such thing as morality at all. The authors are not at all
                            anti-scientific, and certainly aren't in the least pro-religion. Rather,
                            they are two left-of-center academians who recognize that an attempt to
                            explain away morality allows anyone to justify their actions, good or
                            bad.</d:para>

                        <d:para>An electronic book from Amazon.com. The formatting was absolute
                            trash. Instead of electronic text, the book consisted of electronic
                            images of scanned pages. The images didn't even fit 100% within the
                            viewer, and the type was painfully small. And I suspect that there are
                            some pages missing. Despite this, The Republic may be Plato's most
                            famous work. It is written as a dialoge between Socrates and his
                            friends, and begins with some of his colleagues asserting that the
                            unjust are happier than the just. The rest of the book is an examination
                            of justice, happiness and the nature of the city state that would
                            promote justice. It is best to think of this as a "thought experiment"
                            rather than a handbook for a political platform. Because many of his
                            ideas, taken simply at face value, sound more like the republic of
                            Florence under Savoronella, or the Bolshevik Soviet Union or Nazi
                            Germany. Indeed, Plato's (or Socrates, I'm not sure if these are truly
                            Socrates' views) suggestions point to the modern obession of developing
                            the right social structure to ensure human flourishing. But if, instead,
                            you read it a framework for questioning human learning and behavior in
                            the pursuit of betterment, it is still useful even if some of the
                            prescriptions have been disproven by later history. All in all, I prefer
                            Aristotle's "lecture" style of writing and his emphasis on achieving the
                            "mean" between an excess and a dearth of a virtue to Plato's dialogues
                            and emphasis on the eternal forms. Too many times, Socrates' companions
                            are little more than strawmen, or worse, sycophants who simply agree
                            with everything he proposes.</d:para>

                        <d:para>An extended poem describing the tenets of Epicureanism. Key points
                            are that all matter is ultimately composed of tiny objects (he tends to
                            call germs, but what we would call atoms) and empty spaces; that this
                            matter is eternal and of infinite number, that everything composed of
                            these basic building blocks is not eternal, that everything is explained
                            by the interaction of these objects and the forces which cause them to
                            move. Epicurus said that there were gods, but that they were not
                            involved in the natural order; Lucretius seems more inclined to the view
                            that gods don't exist. (Although he does dedicate the poem to Venus -
                            the may simply be a manner of style.) The reading is tough sledding;
                            perhaps his Latin poetry was elequent. This translation certainly is not
                            although it does seem dated. As a work of science, like most
                            "scientific" works from the classical era, it contains many errors of
                            interpretation of how nature works. But as a work of history of
                            scientific thought, it is a useful illustration of how the ancients
                            reasoned. If their conclusions were often wrong, the process of
                            observation and rational argument clearly anticipate modern scientific
                            methods.</d:para>

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para>Dr. Hart presents an argument for the existence of God by refuting
                            atheist attempts to limit all knowledge to that which can be physically
                            verified in the framework of the scientific method. More importantly, he
                            reformulates the common arguments for the existence of God as
                            traditionally espoused by the world's great religions (as well as the
                            Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle.) In summary, the very
                            fact that the universe exists (which science cannot explain because it
                            can only deal in the realm of what already exists) is the primary
                            argument. Science can deal with an endless chain of causes and effects,
                            but there must be an "uncreated" and "unchanging" being outside of any
                            cause and effect for anything to exist at all. The fact that we all have
                            and recognize consciousness is his next proof; he argues against any
                            attempts to explain consciousness as a result of any purely material
                            cause. Incidentally, he includes a very strong critique on the idea of
                            "artificial intelligence" and the analogy of the brain (and
                            intelligence) as some sort of advanced "computer" algoritm.  Finally,
                            the sense of bliss, for instance in human kind's pursuit of the good,
                            the true and the beautiful. "God is thus experienced as that bliss in
                            which our natures have their consumation because that bliss is already,
                            in God, the perfect consumation of divine unity of being and
                            consciousness: infinite being knows itself in infinite consciousness and
                            therefore infinetely rejoices." This is not a work for the casual
                            reader. True to his style, there are many long sentences and arcane
                            words. But his arguments are clear, thorough and easy to
                            follow.</d:para>

                        <d:para>This book came from Stacy's father's collection; her brother Tom
                            recommended that I read it. The reason I hadn't planned on reading this
                            book, indeed the reason I have taken so long to actually getting around
                            to reading it is that I had developed a prejudice against the book in my
                            time as a Midshipman. The book was published in 1987, when I was a
                            Plebe. This was during the very heart of the Reagan era defense build up
                            of conventional military forces to contest the Soviets. The Reagan era
                            also saw many heated debates between those who contended that America
                            was on the decline due to Vietnam and economic competition with Japan
                            and those who argued for the expansion of American military power and an
                            aggressive policy to counter Soviet influence. Needless to say, the more
                            popular view at the Naval Academy was in support of an active,
                            "muscular" American involvement in world affairs. When Mr. Kennedy's
                            book was published, I remember that it was lauded by those were on the
                            other side of the argument. As I was young, and didn't enjoy the idea
                            that the United States could be a declining power, I was inherently
                            disposed to avoid the book. A further prejudice against the book was a
                            result of Mr. Kennedy's very bad luck to have published it just two
                            years before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet
                            military threat. He joined the very long list of experts who failed to
                            forsee this prospect.</d:para>
                        <d:para>Having finally read his book, this serves as a very useful reminder
                            to question your prejudices. The central premise of the book is to
                            examine the how various nations rose to great power in the periods fo
                            1500 - 1987 and then fell from power. It gives very great weight to the
                            ecomonic component of power, and if it has a central argument, it is
                            that it is very expensive to maintain military forces strong enough to
                            project power, and it is even more expensive to maintain a strong
                            military presence far from a nation's border. Mr. Kennedy does not
                            discount the role that diplomatic and military skill and technical
                            innovation play in creating a powerful nation. He simply asks the
                            obvious question of how a nations economy can support its ambitions. For
                            instance, in discussing Germany during World War I, he offers an
                            explanation for the food shortages in Germany that I have not
                            encountered before. The most common explanation was that the British
                            naval blockade was so efffective. But given the large landmass of
                            Germany and the Austria-Hungarian empire, this never seemed to be a
                            convincing argument. Much more convincing is Mr. Kennedy's argument that
                            the sheer number of men pulled into the miiltary (and the armament
                            factories) resulted in a critical shortage of manpower left to support
                            agriculture. </d:para>
                        <d:para>There is nothing anti-American (or anti- any particular nation) in
                            his arguments, and he made no predictions that Japan, or the Soviets, or
                            the Chinese would inevitably surplant the US as a global power. Indeed,
                            he is very balanced in evaluating the relative strenghs and weaknesses
                            of the large powers at the end of the 20th century. He clearly
                            recognized the great strain the Cold War had placed upon the Soviet
                            economy, but like nearly everyone else, he had no idea how quickly the
                            Soviet Union would collapse. Rather than arguing that Japan would
                            surpass the US, he anticipates many of the problems that would hinder
                            Japan since the 1990's. And he noted the rise of the Chinese economy
                            since the death of Mao, and gave some thought to the impact of sustained
                            growth yet did not anticipate just how far China would advance. And he
                            did not forsee (but who did?) the economic revolution of computer
                            technology. But his central examination of the relationship of economic
                            development (and decline) with political, diplomatic and military power
                            seems to me to be quite sound.</d:para>

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para>The second of Mr. Atkinson's three-volume history of the U.S. Army
                            in Europe in WWII. This volume covers the invasion of Sicily and the
                            Italian campaign through the capture of Rome on June 5, 1944. As always,
                            Mr. Atkinson delivers a compelling narrative. He does an excellent job
                            weaving first hand accounts into the flow of events. He follows some
                            individuals thoughout the couse of the campaing, and weaves in other
                            individual voices to highlight particular events. He does not offer bold
                            judgements of those in command, but he does evaluate controversies from
                            all sides; noting the generally accepted verdicts while presenting the
                            case of those being judged. In this volume, General Patton's slapping of
                            two hospitalized soldiers and General Mark Clark's attacks along the
                            Rapido River and the break out from Anzio are clearly the subjects that
                            have received the most criticism over the years. Mr. Atkinson presents
                            all the available facts, the reactions of those who particated in the
                            events, the reactions of other officers and later historians and an
                            occasional pointed comment of his own. But in the end, he leaves the
                            reader to their own judgement.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Highly recommended by Joseph Epstein. A common sense evaluation of
                            how to write with good style. Certainly a highly subjective goal, but
                            Mr. Lucas' suggestions seem to me to be on the right track. In summary:
                            be honest, be consise, end sentences with strong words and paragraphs
                            with strong sentences, pay attention to metre and don't be afraid of
                            "poetic" devices such as simile and metaphor. In style, this book comes
                            across as a lecture by a professor of long tenure. It is dated in the
                            sense that many of his examples are in French or Greek. Perhaps, as a
                            result of frequent trips to the endnotes for the translations, this
                            makes his chapters seem longer than they need to be. If Mr. Epstein was
                            a student of Mr. Lucas in developing his own style, then I would say
                            that the student has surpassed the master.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Anna is reading this in her English class. When I was ordering the
                            electronic version of the book from Amazon, I was amused by one review
                            in which the reader was disappointed that there was very little romance
                            in the letters, but a great deal of instruction on how to run a
                            monastery! The modern idea of a love letter is based on the Greek
                            version of love Eros. While Peter and Heloise do acknowledge their
                            "erotic" love, the letters are really more centered on the Greek version
                            of love Agape. These are letters between two very intelligent and highly
                            educated people, so the letters read generally read more like academic
                            treatises than personal letters. But they do offer a very personal
                            insight into life in medieval life and philosophy. </d:para>

                        <d:para>An introduction to the theology of Thomas Aquinas. Mr. Turner's

                            St. Thomas' style was plain and direct. I prefer G.K. Chesterton's book
                            in terms of biography and I prefer Peter Kreeft's A Shorter Summa as an
                            introduction to his theology. But this book is worthwhile if you want

                        <d:para>Capt. Junger's memoirs of his service in the German army in WWI. He
                            survived four years of combat in the trenches and was wounded 7 times.
                            Here is his account of the battlefield: "The Modern battlefield is like
                            a huge, resting piece of machinery. Countless hidden eyes, ears, and
                            arms are idly watching for some poor sould to arrive alone at any
                            minute. Then as a fiery overture, a single red flare rises high above
                            from some hole in the earth. A thousand guns roar at the same time. At a
                            stroke, the work of annihilation begins, driven by countless levers and
                            its crushing gears. Battlefield commands increase like sparks and
                            flaxhes through a tight electrical network. This initiates and spurs on
                            increased destruction. From the rear areas, a steady stream of new
                            people and material are set in motion, and thrown into the surge of
                            annihilation. Everyone feels compelled to reach the focal point of the
                            deadly new events. It is as if a whirlpool seizes them from afar, and a
                            mysterious will yanks them in with a relentless precision."</d:para>
                        <d:para>One interesting note about Junger. After serving in combat for four
                            years and winning the highest medals awarded by the German army, he
                            never rose above the rank of Captain nor served in a higher capacity
                            than that of company commander. Tocqueville, in Democracy in Amercia,
                            expresses the opinion that in war, democracies are at a disadvantage a
                            the start of the war but have the advantage in an extended conflict
                            (book 2, chapter 24). He suggests this is the case because in a
                            democracy, military service is generally undesirable and those who are
                            ambitious take their talents to other fields. In contrast, in an
                            aristocracy, the officer class comes from the nobility and tends to
                            attract the best of that class. Junger was not from the aristocracy and
                            enlisted at the start of the war. The German army was quick to promote
                            promising enlisted men to the rank of 2nd Lieutenant, which is what
                            happened with Junger after his first stint in the trenches in 1914. From
                            that point forward, he was promoted twice in a period of about 4 years.
                            In the modern American army, all junior officers can expect to be
                            promoted with the exact same rapitidty. Yet he was one of the finest
                            soldiers in the German army with extensive experience in combat. He does
                            note quite frequently that officers of longer tenure (and often with
                            noble titles) were promoted ahead of him. So perhaps Toqueville's
                            suggestion has some merit, at least in this case. </d:para>

                        <d:para>When you write a book as astute and well regarded as this, a book to
                            which academics still turn more than a century later, you may be so
                            lucky as Toqueville and be rewarded with an introduction by Joseph
                            Epstein.  Mr. Epstein begins his introduction with this: "The older one
                            gets, the more it becomes clear that it is a great mistake not to have
                            been brilliant when very young. Difficult to arrange, I realize, but
                            what a splendid saving of time it is to come into one's intelligence
                            early!" This is a long work, undertaken by the author not so much to
                            study the United States as to understand the impact of the dying of
                            European aristocracy and the rise of individual freedom, political
                            liberty and democratic government. He travelled in the United States and
                            offers brilliant insight in to the strengths and weaknesses of the young
                            nation. And he offers commentary on what he thinks this means for the
                            future of democratic government. I found myself highlighting far more
                            passages than I can include here for future consideration. But as a
                            warning, I found that this book is best taken in short, regular doses.
                            His writing focuses on the abstractions he forms from the experiences of
                            his study and his travels. His style is direct and he has the gift of
                            creating a very vivid abstraction. Equally often, too much abstraction
                            without supporting detail makes it hard to hold interest. </d:para>

                            by Amazon I will count it. This is Plato's account of Socrate's defense
                            during his trial for atheism and corruption of youth. This should be
                            required reading for all high school students.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Inherited this from either Granpa Rodine or Nanny. I'm not a huge
                            poetry fan, so it took a while to get through his longer poems, such as
                            "Song of Hiawatha." Long though this poem was, it was still an
                            interesting retelling of Native American folklore. "Evangaline" was
                            another long poem, but I did not care for it's soap opera twists and
                            turns of fate.</d:para>
