            <d:para>Stacy gave this book to me for Christmas, and just like in 2009, I started the
                year off with a book about the Navy. One of my favorite books about the Civil War
                was <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="underline">The Warrior
                    Generals</emphasis> by Commander Thomas Buell (ret.) It was a thought provoking
                examination of four generals, two Union and two Confederate. And it was a delight to
                read. Perhaps more to be expected by a retired Naval officer turned historian, this
                is the biography of Admiral Raymond Spruance, a man of towering accomplishment who
                is generally overshadowed by the more flamboyant figures of WWII. But CDR Buell's
                writing is just as clear and compelling in this book as it was in <emphasis
                    xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="underline">The Warrior
                    Generals</emphasis>. It is difficult to pinpoint just what it is about his style
                that I find so compelling. As a career Naval Officer, he has an insider's view into
                Admiral Spruance's career, yet I believe this book would be as accessible to a
                civilian as it is to a former Naval Officer. He evaluates Adm Spruance's actions
                with a professional eye, and provides judgement on any controversial actions or
                decisions in just a few well crafted sentences. </d:para>

            <d:para>John Henry Cardinal Newman's account of his conversion to the Catholic Church.
                The style is very dry and cerebral; and Cardinal Newman seems sensitive to charges
                that he had been less than forthright in his days as an Anglican priest. In
                contemporary America, with its celebration of the supremacy of the individual and
                emphasis on the individual's relationship with God, this tone seems defensive. But
                in early Victorian Britain, with its ingrained prejudice against Catholicism and
                belief in English superiority, the tone is perhaps more understandable. Indeed,
                Cardinal Newman retains his British sense of upright behavior, refusing to
                proselytize for the Catholic faith. Rather he gives an honest account of how,
                through his research into the teachings of the Church fathers, he came to view the
                Anglican Church as heretical. This account really may only appeal to a serious
                theologian. Where his account is of interest to a broader audience is in his
                criticism of the "Liberal" party in the Anglican Church and the danger of the
                liberal promotion of personal behavior and rejection of dogma. Given the current
                state of the Anglican Church, Cardinal Newman's warnings seem to be
                confirmed.</d:para>

            <d:para>Lieutenant Commander John Owen was the team Chaplain for the Navy Football team
                for the 2007 season. The book is really a collection of his pre-game talks to the
                team combined with his reflections on his role as a religious teacher in a secular
                institution. Personally, the talks aren't interesting. What is interesting are the
                inside observations of the players and coaches who participated in one of the best
                season's in Navy football history.</d:para>

            <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">An engaging and stimulating collection of
                essays by a contemporary Orthodox theologian. I found his essay regarding Pope John
                Paul II's outreach to the Orthodox church to be particularly insightful. Mr. Hart is
                a formidable opponent of secular materialists and militant Darwinists. This can make
                for delightfully entertaining passages. In this season of Lent, I wonder whether to
                admire his spirited defense of Christianity or blush at his refusal to turn the
                other cheek to his enemies. While this observation is made somewhat light-heartedly,
                it is a point to ponder. Christian humility certainly does not preclude a spirited
                defense or promotion of Christianity. But when the tone descends to the level of
                squabbling academics, has a line between humility and pride been traversed? But the
                reading was entertaining enough that I won't take him to task too severely. Reading
                these essays is also a great way to improve your vocabulary. Mr. Hart most assuredly
                does not believe in writing at a layman's level. Turning, at random to a single page
                (which happened to fall in the essay "The Laughter of the Philosophers") consisting
                of 38 lines, the following words provide an example of his formidable vocabulary:

            <d:para>An edition of the Oxford History of the United States; the same series that
                includes James McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom. Stephen Brumbaugh lent this book
                to me. A comprehensive examination of the military, political, religious, artistic
                and social history of the United States from the end of the War of 1812 to the end
                of the Mexican War. In some respects, a very balanced account with no revisionist
                economic or social theory to explain the events. He details both the great
                accomplishments and the glaring iniquities of the period. Perhaps the greatest
                strength of this book is coverage of the role that religion played in America during
                this period. Perhaps because my interest has always been more for military history,
                religion tends to be overlooked unless it is plainly unavoidable (such as in dealing
                with the Mormon migration to Utah). For example, in all the books by Bruce Catton, I
                don't remember any discussion on the religious influences or practices of either the
                Union or the Confederacy. Mr. Howe does a nice job in showing how religious beliefs
                and practices led to concrete social and political results.</d:para>
            <d:para>However, there are some glaring weaknesses as well. While purporting to provide
                a narrative of the period, he never the less is not shy about passing judgement upon
                people and their actions. For example, during the Battle of New Orleans, the British
                commander assigned one of his Irish units the task of carrying bundles of brush to
                fill in the ditch in front of the American lines. For whatever reason, the commander
                of the Irish unit failed to make the arrangements and the subsequent British attack
                was badly hampered. The dereliction of this commander is self evident even to
                someone not versed in military history, and simply describing the situation allows
                anyone with any intelligence to draw the appropriate conclusion. But Mr. Howe still
                provides his personal judgement on the Irish commander's culpability. And the
                yardstick Mr. Howe uses to make his judgements is to compare are modern conventions
                of right and wrong. This shows him to fall in the "progressive" school of historians
                who view all history as a long development to the present "enlightened" time. In Mr.
                Howe's defense, this is probably the most typical outlook of modern historians. The
                problem with this approach is that many times the historian is quick to see the
                faults of his subject without evaluating how the virtues of the subject compare with
                the faults of the author and his society.</d:para>

            <d:para>This is a very short work detailing how a single act of selfishness causes a
                chain of consequences. This serves as a useful vehicle for Tolstoy to examine some
                of the ignoble facets of the Russian society of his day. The chain of misfortunes,
                however, also spurs some positive actions, mostly by characters who share Tolstoy's
                personal view of Christianity and its place for social reform. The problem with
                Tolstoy's view of Christianity is that it is essentially a Protestant view in which
                the individual is capable of working out his relationship with Christ and that the
                Church is generally a hindrance to this process. But G.K. Chesterton offers a strong
                critique of this view: "My point is that the world did not tire of the Church's
                ideal, but of its reality. Monasteries were impugned not for the chastity of monks,
                but for the unchastity of monks. Christianity was unpopular not because of the
                humility, but the arrogance of Christians. Certainly if the church failed it was
                largely through the churchmen." In each and every age, the Church and society in
                general are composed of the saints, the ordinary and the wicked. In each age, the
                saints carry forward the holiness of the Church despite the wickedness of the bad
                and the indifference of the ordinary. When an individual, or a group decides to
                leave the Church on account of the bad and the indifference, they also leave behind
                the saints. When they start their own church (as the Lutherans, Anglicans, etc.)
                they wind up in the same boat, only with a smaller crew. And when eventually one or
                more individuals in the protesting church leaves on account of the bad and
                indifferent, then a cascading chain of splintering churches is the result. So while
                Tolstoy is certainly right to point out the shortcomings of the Orthodox Church in
                the last years of the Romanov dynasty, his complete rejection of the Church winds up
                illustrating the point that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Surely
                Satan is aware of the military maxim "Divide and Conquer."</d:para>

                Nanny. It was very interesting reading this book after having read Evan Thomas'
                Jones bio just two years ago. I went back to my review of Mr. Thomas' biography to
                ensure that it was rated lower than the grade I assigned to this one (and indeed, I
                had rated it lower). In a way, an entire essay could be devoted to the differences
                between these two books. But to be brief, ADM Morison's credentials as an historian,
                his passion for sailing and his experience as historian for the US Navy during World
                War II provide greater credibility than Mr. Thomas' background as a reporter
                (all-be-it a very successful reporter). Given that the material covered was almost
                identical, Adm. Morison's book was more interesting, more balanced and more
                insightful.</d:para>

                summarized by the quote from the back of the dust jacket: "Throughout these years,
                the power of the State to do evil expanded with awesome speed. Its power to do good
                grew slowly and ambiguously." I will certainly return to this book later as Mr.

            <d:para>It is not uncommon now days to argue that General Lee has been over-rated by
                historians, and Mr. Bonekemper has made a bid to be the coup-de-grace to Lee's
                reputation. While not quite descending to the level of jeremiad, Mr. Bonekemper
                misses no chance to point out Gen. Lee's faults. This is somewhat a shame, because
                he does have some good points to make. In fact, there are a number of very telling
                arguments. First, that Lee was too aggressive - and he presents some interesting
                figures to back this up. The statistics that he cites demonstrate that Lee lost more
                soldiers than any General in the war, both in raw numbers and in percentage of his
                forces lost. His poor staff work and overly complex plans helped contribute to the
                heavy losses. Mr. Bonekemper also suggests that Lee learned to be very aggressive in
                the Mexican War, when muskets and cannon had much less range and accuracy - which is
                an argument that I have not heard before but is worth consideration. He suggests
                that Lee should have used his influence to end the war in 1864 to prevent
                unnecessary bloodshed. Lee's invasions of the North were fatally flawed because
                given the scope of his plans, he was going to have to march his army back south at
                the end of the campaign, regardless of what happened along the way, and leave the
                impression that he had been forced to retire. He completely neglected the rest of
                the confederacy to focus on Virginia - which is perhaps the argument that most
                closely supports the assertion in the title of the book. There are a number of flaws
                in Mr. Bonekemper's presentation. He argues with the gift of hindsight, as if his
                conclusions were as glaringly obvious then as they are now. He makes no effort to
                identify what Lee did right. Indeed, his book reads as the summation by the
                prosecution rather than a intellectual evaluation. His chronological narrative does
                not support his arguments particularly well - he would have been better off
                organizing the book around his chief arguments.</d:para>

            <d:para>This is the second time that I have read this book; this time prompted by having
                read Bonekemper's "How Lee Lost the Civil War" and Buell's bio of Admiral Spruance.
                I can't quite put my finger on what makes his style so distinctive, but I find his
                books hard to put down. In addition to style, he brings a tremendous amount of
                common sense to military subjects based upon his own career in the Navy. Mr. Buell
                focuses his attention on three Generals from the Union (Grant, Thomas and Barlow)
                and three Confederate generals (Lee, Hood and Gordon). He is pretty hard on both
                Grant and Lee, both of whom fought with tenacity but not always with skill. Both
                were weak in staff work and logistics and their short comings prevented them from
                achieving better results. Mr. Buell is perhaps a little hard on Grant, going so far
                as to label his 1864 campaign in Virginia as a failure. But no matter the tactical
                setbacks he experienced, he never lost the initiative and by refusing to disengage
                from Lee, he was sure to win in the end. Like Mr. Bonekemper, Buell criticizes Lee's
                lavish expenditure of his soldiers lives, but he is a bit more understanding of
                Lee's grand design to win the war for the Confederacy. Lee's intention was to
                influence northern opinion by sapping the will of the Army of the Potomac to fight
                and the will of the northern public to endure the losses and humiliation - all while
                preventing the Union army from over running his native state. In the end, he was
                unsuccessful - not for lack of will but for opportunities lost due to poor
                intelligence, missing maps, poor staff work and the loss of his best generals and
                soldiers due to aggressive tactics. The next pair of generals are Thomas and Hood.
                Buell argues that Thomas was the outstanding general of the war because he lacked
                none of the shortcomings of Lee and Grant. In fact, his staff work, logistical
                planning and intelligence operations clearly foreshadowed modern American combined
                operations. He defends Thomas from the denigrating comments by Grant and Sherman
                that he was superb on defense but slow to attack. One short coming of Thomas, and
                Buell does admit this, was his inability to communicate effectively with Grant and
                Sherman, which ultimately reduced his effectiveness. Another criticism that Buell
                missed is that Thomas' approach to war ignored politics. While he recognized that
                the only way to defeat the Confederacy was to destroy the southern armies, he wasn't
                as sensitive to northern politics as were Grant and Sherman. Perhaps his disdain for
                politics led him to feel a certain amount of disdain for Grant and Sherman, who were
                both political operators as well as generals. Hood gets perhaps the shortest shrift
                in the book and only seems to serve as a foil to illustrate the ultimately
                superiority of the northern methods of waging war. Hood was superb as a brigade and
                even division commander, largely average in a short stint as a corps commander and
                an absolute disaster as an army commander. The final pair of generals are Barlow and
                Gordon. Gordon had a sterling career, steadily moving up the ranks due to
                aggressiveness in battle. Barlow too gradually rose up through the ranks, although
                not quite as high as Gordon. The big contrast between the two warriors was that
                Gordon never really adapted his tactics as the war progressed, whereas Barlow
                learned to transition from tightly massed formations to flexible skirmish lines
                which could take advantage of the terrain.</d:para>

            <d:para>A short novel written from the point of view of a young radical. Perhaps not up
                to his best standards, but Dostoevsky has a skill for taking an individual aliened
                from society and treating them sympathetically. The end result is that he more
                clearly illustrates the negative consequences of how they choose to respond to their
                alienation than if he had written a polemical essay against the folly of the
                "modern" reaction against all aspects of "traditional" society. He very clearly
                illustrates how the moderns "throw the baby out with the bath water" in their
                reaction against the negative features of their society and their fellow man. The
                short story "The Dream of the Ridiculous Man" was interesting - it seems to be
                another aliened young man who has turned to nihilism, but instead has a vision that
                transforms his life. Instead of a nihilist raging against society, he is transformed
                into a prophet in the mold of St. Paul. Interestingly enough, his vision could very
                well have been the idea for C.S. Lewis' story Out of the Silent Planet and also
                seems to be reflected in the book I am currently reading - Walker Percy's <emphasis

            <d:para>Well written and thought provoking. General Hooker had many things going for him
                - excellent logistics, planning, staff work and infantry organization. Lee had very
                little going for him, terrible logistics, a third of his army absent from the battle
                and the loss of his best General about half way through the battle. Yet Lee managed
                to win a spectacular but ultimately costly and inclusive victory. Hooker had bad
                luck, (getting wounded at a critical juncture of the battle, etc.), he badly
                mishandled his cavalry and artillery and perhaps no general in the Civil War
                received worse performance from his subordinates. He also divided his forces,
                allowing Lee to shift back and forth between both wings of his army. In the end, he
                was unable to overcome the mistakes. The irony is that 6 weeks later, George Meade
                fought exactly the type of battle that Hooker wanted to fight - allowing Lee to
                repeatedly attack his prepared positions at Gettysburg. </d:para>

                recorded lecture by Peter Kreeft in which he compared this book with C.S. Lewis'
                    <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="underline">The Abolition
                    of Man</emphasis>. It is funny to think of someone, perhaps a science fiction
                fan or amateur astronomer, stumbling upon this book seeing the title and thinking,
                "hey, this might be for me." But the "Last Self-Help Book" is sub-title is quite
                ironic, and if this book is a self-help book for anyone, it would be for
                philosophers, artists and scientist. Actually, Mr. Percy's approach in this book is
                probably as close to the Socratic method as anything I have read. He defines some
                terms relating to semiotics (the study of symbols) and spends the rest of the book
                asking questions and suggesting "thought experiments." Perhaps the single,
                overarching question in the book is from the dust jacket - "Why is it possible to
                learn more in ten minutes about the Crab Nebula in Taurus, which is 6,000
                light-years away, than you presently know about yourself, even though you've been
                stuck with yourself all your life?" </d:para>

            <d:para>The second book in Lewis' Space Trilogy, this book has much less action than the
                first installment; indeed, much less action than one typically expects from the
                science fiction genre. Instead, this book is an extended reflection upon the fall of
                man in the Garden of Eden and a look forward to the end times foretold in the Book
                of Revelation. The scenes where Westin (or rather the demon possessing Weston) is
                trying to tempt the Queen of Perelandra is a very subtle, persistent and disturbing
                - one wishes for the action to proceed to escape the oppressive atmosphere. Yet
                Westin's blandishments are so familiar - one can think of many examples in the
                media, in academia, in advertising and pop-culture - in which we are constantly
                bombarded with these empty promises. This book definitely calls for a second reading
                to fully explore Mr. Lewis' arguments and symbols.</d:para>

            <d:para>It is interesting how different is each of the books that comprise Lewis' Space
                Trilogy. The first, <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="underline"
                    >Out of the Silent Planet</emphasis>, is probably closest to contemporary
                science fiction. <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="underline"
                    >Perelandra</emphasis> is an extended theological exploration and <emphasis

                fast-paced and gripping account of what happens when science loses connection to
                morality. As I read this book, I felt it would be a nice companion piece to

            <d:para>Recorded book. I first read this book 15 years ago after reading A Soldier of
                the Great War. The story was gripping, but so fantastic that it was hard to know
                what to make of it. I was delighted to find this on CD at the library. Although Mr.
                Helprin is Jewish, when I first read this book I thought that it had a very "Roman
                Catholic" outlook. This book resembles nothing so much as an artistic interpretation
                of the coming of the Messiah and the Apocalypse. The writing is beautiful, the
                characters are noble.</d:para>

            <d:para>Read from an open source e-book. The quality of the scan wasn't great - in
                particular, it had great difficulty with the footnote on the bottom of the page,
                especially if they extended to the next page. The history of heresies suffer in
                comparison to military histories in that theological battles are waged by scholars
                and theologians over fine shades of meaning, yet this book shows the very great
                consequences caused by even fine shades of meaning. For in all human affairs, there
                seems to be a never ending struggle between those who seek the truth and thus seek
                maximum precision in their language and those who seek some earthly reward - usually
                power, sometimes money - who are willing to shade meanings to hide their true
                intentions. When Constantine became emperor of Rome and became interested in
                Christianity as a means of unifying his empire, the stakes in theological disputes
                were raised immensely. This is an excellent defense of the Catholic position against
                the Arians and an excellent example of why the pursuit of truth and the accurate use
                of language are so important. Also, a good treatment of the career of St. Athanasius
                is woven throughout the narrative - this will be of interest to Thomas some
                day..</d:para>

            <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">This novel was recommended in a lecture I
                listened to by Peter Kreeft. A much more polished open source e-book that
                illustrates the great benefit of the open source movement in e-books. It is hard to
                describe this book - the story is set in a suburb of London - a new development
                surrounding an old hill-top estate with an ancient history. The plot revolves around
                a local stage production of a play by the poet who inhabits the old estate. The
                story tracks some residents on the path to heaven in contrast with others who are on
                the descent mentioned in the title. The language is often dense, time becomes
                non-linear and the boundary between the living and the dead becomes blurred - indeed
                the writing at times seems more free verse than prose, yet the book is still oddly
                compelling for all that. Here is an example of a particularly dense sentence:</para>
            <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">"Much difficulty in finding what? in finding
                it? the it that could be found if he thought of himself more; that was what he had
                said or she had said, whichever had said that the thing was to be found, as if Adela
                had said it, Adela in her real self, by no means the self that went with Hugh; no,
                but the true, the true Adela who was apart and his; for that was the difficulty all
                the while, that she was truly his, and wouldn't be, but if he thought more of her
                truly being, and not of her being untruly away, on whatever way, for the way that
                went away was not the way she truly went, but if they did away with the way she went
                away, then Hugh could be untrue and she true, then he would know themselves, two,
                true and two, on the way he was going, and the peace in himself, and the scent of
                her in him, and the her, meant for him, in him; that was the she he knew, and he
                must think the more of himself." But this sentence occurs at the great turning point
                when one of the protagonists, Mr. Wentworth, begins his descent in earnest. As nice
                as this was in e-book form, I would like to read this one again in text.</para>

            <d:para>I stumbled across this book on an on-line collection of open source books, and
                this is an example of a hidden treasure made easily accessible by the e-book. Any
                midshipman at the Naval Academy is familiar with Capt Mahan's name thanks to Mahan
                Hall, and those who did not sleep through their Naval History course would recognize
                him as the author of a book that influenced nearly all navies from 1900 until about
                1940. This biography was written two years after Capt. Mahan wrote <emphasis
                    xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="underline">The Influence of Sea
                    Power Upon History</emphasis>. In style, very similar to Samuel Elliot Morrison
                (I don't know if this was a conscious imitation of Mahan's style by Morrison, or
                just a reflection of the pre-modern academic style.) It is easily accessible to the
                layman yet very stimulating to those familiar with the Navy. This would be excellent
                reading for midshipman, because Capt. Mahan's central concern is not so much to
                celebrate Farragut's accomplishments as to understand how his development as a naval
                officer allowed him to achieve greatness when called to duty in the Civil

            <d:para>Mr. Fermor passed away this year. The day after I read his obituary in the Wall
                Street Journal, Tom Kalaris (Stacy's brother) sent an e-mail stating that Mr. Fermor
                was one of his personal heroes. So I found this book at Barnes and Noble and picked
                it up as a Father's Day present. Mr. Fermor provides a vivid portrait of the lands
                and people in Austria and Romania in the years immediately before World War II. This
                book is actually the second in a series of three books describing his trip on foot
                from Holland to Constantinople following his expulsion from college. (The third
                volume was not published at the time of his death.) Stylistically, this book is very
                well crafted, sometimes even spectacular. But the problem with a travelog is that
                there are plenty of small obstacles overcome, but no resolution of weighty matters
                that would provide depth..</d:para>

            <d:para>Stylistically, this borders on dry academic prose, but that may be partly a
                translation issue. What this book does, and does very well, is to provide an
                overview of the events in the life of Jesus from Palm Sunday through the
                Crucifixion, balancing the Church's understanding and interpretation of these events
                with an examination of scholarly interpretation. If the end result were just a
                rehash of scholarly opinion, this book would rate a lower score. But Pope Benedict
                raises our view above the debates of the scholars to remind us of the miracle that
                has become the very reason for faith and the center point of all of the history of
                mankind..</d:para>

            <d:para>This is one of those classics about which everyone knows a little, but which few
                have taken the time to actually read. The details of the adventure story are well
                known; a man shipwrecked on a deserted island who manages to survive for many years
                alone, the psychological impact of the discovery of a single footprint upon the
                sand, and the relationship with Friday, whom he rescues from an enemy tribe. Yet
                just as interesting are Crusoe's musings on man's relationship with God - indeed
                Crusoe's developing faith can be taken as the key theme of the entire work. This is
                perhaps, a very Protestant take on theology - a man drawing closer to God through
                his reading of the Bible and his own prayers and reflections. But aside from some
                comments about Papists and priest craft, his treatment of Catholics is much better
                than one would expect from a post-Reformation Englishman. The book is actually quite
                gripping up to the point of the rescue of Friday. From there on out, it returns to
                being simply a run-of-the-mill adventure story.</d:para>

            <d:para>If you read enough history of the US in the period between 1800 and 1830, you
                will inevitably encounter the figure of John Randolph of Roanoke, usually presented
                as an acid tongued curmudgeon with a rapier wit and an irredeemably bad temper. In
                these accounts, his prime accomplishment was his duel with Henry Clay. Mr. Kirk
                provides a much more balanced view, presenting Randolph as a champion of individual
                rights and a Cassandra warning of the dangers of unchecked Federal power. His views
                can best be summarized, perhaps, by a phrase used by Randolph: "Change is not

            <d:para>John Polkinghorne is a quantum physicist turned Anglican priest, and this book
                is a collection of essays on the ways science and religion complement each other.
                Stylistically, it is rather dry, as one would expect of a physicist, but his
                knowledge of both the language and methodologies of science and theology give him a
                very balance point of view that stands against the atheism of some scientists and
                the anti-scientism of some fundamentalists. Earlier this year, the famous physicist
                Steven Hawkings wrote an article that asserts that the universe does not need a
                creator as the law of gravity was sufficient cause in and of itself. He attempted to
                argue his point in the language of philosophy and addressed some of the proofs for
                Gods existence addressed by St. Thomas Aquinas. But his arguments were ill-organized
                and slip-shod. Mr. (Dr. ? Father? I'm not sure of the Anglican honorific)
                Polkinghorne is able to argue intelligently in both realms and is thus provides a
                more informed opinion.</d:para>

            <d:para>An e-book downloaded from the Project Gutenberg website. I started reading this
                last Lent, and finally finished it this year. This is a very difficult book for a
                modern reader, both in content and in style. To imitate Christ, the author
                continually emphasizes the rejection of worldly interests, the acceptance of trials
                and tribulations and the humility to ignore the opinions of others. In the modern
                world, we are immersed in mass communication enabled by technology, which provides
                an instant and ever changing propagation of public opinion and which contributes to
                the idea that all problems can be resolved with the application of time and money.
                Furthermore, on a personal level, there is a tremendous emphasis on the individual -
                in terms of health and intellect. So if the author is correct in the path of
                following Christ, then this book makes for a very tough pill to swallow.
                Stylistically, the devotional style of the late Middle Ages does not naturally
                appeal the direct, secular modern style. But, just because the book is hard to read
                does not mean it is not true.. </d:para>

            <d:para>I read the first volume of this trilogy when I was in England with Nanny as a
                boy. Thomas and I have just now finished the whole set - some of it read together
                and some by ourselves. This was voted the greatest British novel of the 20th century
                some years ago, prompting much wailing and gnashing of teeth by the literati. For
                those who equate art with "the shock of the new" (to borrow a book title from Robert
                Hughes), Tolkien has little to offer. His writing does not offer "realism" in the
                sense of cynicism, despair, transgression of morals and manners, pseudo
                Freudian-ism, etc. But, of course, no art is "real", but instead abstract
                representations that can be good, beautiful and/or true (or that can willfully
                ignore the good, beautiful and/or true). More than anything else, The Lord of the
                Rings is beautiful; Tolkien seems to have been a man who deeply loved words. He
                loves good, old fashioned words and delights in their use. He loves words so much
                that he even invented languages for the elves and the dwarves, and writes songs and
                poems in these new languages. What makes this work so enduring and so popular, I
                think, is that it appeals to our in-born desire for beauty and goodness and shows
                the world not as it now is, but as it should be. The heroes are not like those we
                know, but reflect a nobility that we wish we could obtain. The dialog is not like
                any conversation we would have with our friends or co-workers, but is fluent and
                true. The plot really could have been taken from any Norse saga, or Greek myth, or
                German fairy tale. This has allowed the books to be made into a series of very good
                action movies. As I mentioned, I read the first volume as a young boy, and while the
                plot did not grip me enough to continue on to the next two volumes, the images of
                the Shire and of the encroaching darkness of evil and the flight of the hobbits from
                the Ring Wraiths have long stuck with me. Indeed, the Shire reminds me of nothing so
                much of Samson's Harbor Farm. What will always draw me back to these books is the
                beauty of the writing. </d:para>

            <d:para>I enjoyed this more than I thought I would; for all of Hamlet's reputation as
                depressed or paralyzed by indecision, the play is not at all morose. I think,
                perhaps some of the reputation of the lead part is more a reflection on the critics
                than on the play. In any event, as far as tragedies go, I still prefer Macbeth.

            <d:para>The images are timeless - Gulliver tied down by the Lilliputians, Gulliver in
                the land of giants, etc. Swift's satire is biting, and sometimes telling even in the
                modern world - i.e. the ultra-rationalistic residents of the floating island of
                Laputa. To my taste, however, his satire comes off less humorous and more preachy -
                more like the crank shouting on the street corner than the wit at a highbrow
                cocktail party. In this sense, I believe that Robinson Crusoe has aged better than
                Gulliver's Travels. But the Jonathan Swift's incredible imagination will likely
                always attract new readers, and really, human nature has not changed so much that
                his satire won't strike home in any age.. </d:para>

            <d:para>A monograph on Marlborough's great victory over the French. Actually there
                wasn't much to the battle. The French line was divided in two with separate
                commanders. Each of the two French commanders anchored their flanks with nearly all
                their infantry leaving the center undermanned with their generally inferior cavalry.
                After futile assaults on the flanks, the cavalry of Marlborough and Eugene smashed
                through the center and captured the French right wing whose infantry was holed up in
                the village of Blenheim. The brilliance of Marlborough and Eugene was in the
                campaign leading up to the battle, moving from the Rhine to the Danube to isolate
                and destroy a combined French and Bavarian force.. </d:para>

            <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">A very readable history of the Greek -
                Persian wars. Stacy gave this to me as a gift for Christmas; she had read an
                interview with her brother Tom and he had recommended the book. Probably the best
                treatment of the Persians that I have read. Does a pretty good job with the who’s
                and hows and whys of the war between the Greeks and Persians. A couple of nit-picks.
                Like many contemporary historians, he wants to rectify a traditional viewpoints with
                regards to the non-Western actors. Like many such attempts, he slips into the trap
                at times of denigrating the Greeks. But he does not carry this to an obnoxious
                extreme. Second, he comes across as a cynic in all matters of religion. As a student
                of politics and military action, he seems to view it as just another tool by which a
                state maintains order. Third, he can be occasionally crass in terms of treating
                sexuality. This might be fine in the locker room among adults, but it will
                definitely prevent me from recommending this to Thomas until he is older. But,
                all-in-all, an enjoyable and profitable read.</para>

            <d:para>His style is very dry and academic, but there are times when Cardinal Newman is
                very insightful. What struck me most was his descriptions, using source material, of
                the pagan establishment’s view of the early Christian. This is entirely foreign to
                the modern reader as our perspective comes about 1600 years following Christianity’s
                eclipse of paganism. But Christianity was such a radical departure for the Roman
                establishment that they truly believed that Christians were “atheists”.</d:para>

                the character and accomplishments of those involved are solid. His judgments on the

            <d:para>I had put off reading this as one reviewer had mentioned that it was somewhat
                lacking in charity to the current popular writers who espouse atheism. But I find
                this judgment itself to be inaccurate. Mr. Hart certainly does not suffer fools
                gladly, but in this case, his sharp words are not aimed at the character of his
                opponents but rather the shallowness of their arguments. Most of the book, rather
                than consisting of attacks upon atheists is rather a presentation of Christian
                history and its contributions to the development of the modern world shorn of the
                current politically correct history of Christianity based upon the distortions of
                the “Enlightenment”. Also, more fully develops the theme of the utter foreignness of
                Christianity to the Roman world as discussed above in the "Essay on the Development
                of Christian Doctrine."</d:para>

            <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">I picked this up for Thomas after he took a
                field trip to Gettysburg. I had not heard of this book, so I started reading it to
                see if it would be worthwhile. Given how much I've already read about Gettysburg, I
                probably would not have looked at it otherwise. But this was such a well written and
                thought-provoking book that I finished the whole thing. Professor Guelzo offers a
                compelling narrative of events, he challenges some of the accepted wisdom about the
                Civil War being the first "modern" conflict, he offers balanced judgements on the
                actions of key figures and he highlights many of the political aspects of the
                "Civil" War. Sometimes his supporting evidence does not support his conclusions -
                for instance he maintains that statistically there was little danger from being hit
                by the inaccurate fire of inexperienced troops, yet elsewhere he describes an
                instance of a row of casualties from a North Carolina regiment on the opening day of
                the battle. But his premise still is worth considering - he contends the mass
                casualties were a result of inexperience troops standing toe to toe to fire for
                extended periods, yet not charging with bayonet. This is born out by evidence of
                units succeeding in seemingly suicidal charges at key points in the battle (the 20th
                Maine at Little Round Top, the 1st Minnesota at the end of day 2, etc.). This book
                is a borderline 5, although as much as I enjoyed reading it, I doubt I shall read it
                again. But I definitely recommend it as first rate military history.</para>

            <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Written in drab academic style, Ms. Faust
                never-the-less has produced an interesting book on how Americans, both soldier and
                civilian, both northern and southern, dealt with the enormous loss of life in the
                Civil War. I can't help but think of William Nevin, who served for 40 days before
                dying of "camp fever." We posses two letters written by Will to his aunt during his
                short service that describe the novelty of army life without any reference to the
                pain and suffering of the war other than a passing mention of a sick tent-mate. When
                I look at the portrait of his father, Theodore Hugh Nevin, that hangs above my
                mantle, I wonder about pain he endured at the loss of his oldest son. </para>

            <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">We visited Nantucket this summer, and this
                book was on the shelf of the house that we rented. I managed to get most of the way
                through the book while on vacation, then checked it out from the library to finish.
                Ms. Weir covers the back-and-forth struggle between the York and Lancaster branches
                of the Plantagenet dynasty, beginning with the overthrow of Richard II and
                concluding with the victory of Edward IV over Henry VI. This era illustrates the
                weakness of the feudal system - strong kings dying young and young kings unable to
                keep the nobility in check. In the political vacuum, the struggles between factions
                in the nobility temporarily weakened the monarchy, but ultimately weakened the lords
                even more. This set the stage for the strong monarchs of the House of Tudor and the
                transition to a more absolute monarchy. </para>

                non-academic (not to mention Hart’s unusually broad vocabulary even when he is
                writing to the general public). I read this on the Kindle app – the ability to look

                downloaded this book from Amazon. Technically not set in the Medieval France, but at
                the period in which the Reformation is just about to break upon Europe. It is a work
                of historical fiction about a court Jester who manages to guide the King of France

                Very similar to Walking Drum; the author’s only interest in the Middle Ages seems to
                be as a backdrop of ignorance, prejudice and violence in which his very modern and
                very English and very Protestant (in outlook, anyway) hero can advance from one
                adventure to the next. The relatively little I know about the English "companies"
                that fought in France during the 100 years war lead me to believe that they were a
                blood thirsty lot little better than the Vikings. There is a second volume that
                accompanies this, but I could not finish the first volume.</para>

            <d:para>Mr. Redondi in Galileo Heretic attempts to put himself in 17th century Italy to
                illustrate to the reader what he feels lead to Galileo’s trial. In contrast, Mr.
                Nicholl attempts to look back from the 20th century to provide his guess at what
                exactly led to the death of poet Christopher Marlowe. Extremely well researched, Mr.
                Nicholl is forced into a great deal of speculation based on a very thin amount of
                material. In his defense, he does an outstanding job of informing the reader on what
                he can prove and on what he leaves to speculation. In the end, there is not enough
                evidence to make a convincing argument, but the book is an excellent introduction to
                the paranoid “spy vs. spy” atmosphere created by the secret police in Elizabeth I’s
                reign.</d:para>

            <d:para>I started this several years ago, ploughing through the sections from the age of
                enlightenment through WWII. I was lost interest when the book reached the Cold War
                as I was generally more familiar with the events of this period. Nonetheless, once I
                started again, I found Mr. Kissinger a very insightful guide to the events that he
                either observed or participated in first hand. Mr. Kissinger was famous when I was a
                child; today he seems only to be discussed when someone levels a charge that he is a
                “war criminal” for some incident or the other in the course of his service. Truth be
                told, Mr. Kissinger pretty accurately describes the species of frustrated idealist
                (peculiar to America, and perhaps to the Communist Party) who views foreign policy
                as a means of advancing their ideals and who treat any rational discussion of
                national interests as a dastardly betrayal of their ideals. The fact that
                Kissinger’s critics can only paint him as some kind of devil while he is able to
                accurately describe this class of critic with an analytic, critical and even
                somewhat sympathetic eye is evidence that he is much closer to the truth than his
                opponents. Other critics lay the charge that he is a cynical practitioner of
                “realpolitik”, but it is clear from this book that he tries to balance the notion of
                rational national interests with the ideals on which the American republic was
                founded.</d:para>

            <d:para>A well written review of the causes of the Great Depression and the attempts to
                revive the American economy in the 1930’s. The subject of the Depression in general
                and the New Deal in particular tends to generate polemics based upon an author’s
                political leanings. While Ms. Shlaes reaches the conclusion that the New Deal did
                not end the depression and may have prolonged it, she presents both sides of the
                argument in a balanced fashion. In particular, she focuses on the lives of a number
                of figures, both famous and obscure, to help illustrate the impact and reactions to
                the economic and political conditions. I will likely buy this book for Thomas for

            <d:para>Third in a series of 5 books in the Game Of Thrones series, although I believe
                the author is currently working on one additional book to conclude the series. As
                I’ve mentioned before, he is a first rate story teller - to that I would add that he
                is a first-rate entertainer. His stories read as if they were movies, which is
                probably why the Game of Thrones TV series is so popular. So I do not begrudge him
                his success; indeed I rank his work with that of Tom Clancy who I think was an
                equally gifted story-teller and entertainer, and perhaps Steven King. But I do have
                a number of nits to pick. 1. The pace of military operations rivals that of the
                armies in World War II more so than the medieval era. The speed with which King
                Baratheon delivered his army from his island base to the far side of the great wall
                would have exceeded the capabilities of most armies in WWII. 2. While he does a
                remarkable job of describing a battle, his tendency to resolve them with an
                unexpected stroke belies the nature of medieval war fare where most battles were
                resolved by the brute weight (literally, given the armor and horses) of the
                contending forces. 3. He has obviously embraced the axiom “show, don’t tell”, but he
                has used the phrase “the juices ran down his chin” far too many times to illustrate
                the fact that one of his characters was ravenously hungry. 4. The explicit sex
                scenes are too much - Mr. Martin, to judge by the publicity photos, is a rather
                over-weight, middle-aged man, and would rather he kept his fantasies entirely to
                himself. As the kids say these days - TMI (“too much information.”) 5. While he
                kills of characters in droves, once he narrates a chapter from someone’s first
                person point of view, it seems like they are in the series for the long haul. In
                this book, Catlyn (sp?) Stark is murdered, yet she is back from the dead in the
                book’s coda. 6. There is too much of the “Perils of Pauline” in his handling of
                Arrya Stark. In fact, at one point I was so annoyed by yet another unexpected turn
                in her fortunes that I skipped ahead to the end of the book to see how everything
                turned out. So, over all I can recommend this series, but I don’t foresee the desire
                to ever read them again.</d:para>

            <d:para>In the 1850’s, Frederick Law Olmsted (future architect of Central Park)
                travelled across the south writing articles for the New York Daily Times. This was
                in the time period shortly after the publication of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, and the paper
                sent him to get a first hand view of the conditions of slaves. He is clearly
                anti-slavery, but no polemicist. More than anything, he is interested in what makes
                a farm successful, and his over-riding impression is that slavery was so grossly
                wasteful that he wondered why anyone would voluntarily continue the practice. He
                also described the unhealthy social effects of slavery on both the servants and the
                masters. These two volumes cover his travels from Washington, DC, to Richmond and
                Norfolk, VA, across North Carolina to coastal South Carolina and Savannah, GA, then
                to Mobile AL, New Orleans and the Red River district of Louisiana. His detailed
                descriptions of his travels are an excellent view of life in the antebellum south.
                The second volume is one of the worst printing jobs I’ve ever seen in a book, at
                least three different pages are duplicated.</d:para>

                Armada, with particular emphasis on the events that precipitated the campaign. Well

            <d:para>Another Christmas gift from Stacy. This is an outstanding work of military
                history. The author is a former British Army officer who frequented the Ardennes
                during his Army career. He turned his interest in his surroundings to excellent use;
                intermixing many first hand accounts of the battle with his own observations of the
                ground and his sound professional judgement. I passed this book on to Uncle

            <d:para>Reminds me very much of James Webb’s “A Country Such as This”, which chronicled
                the careers of three or four (I forget some of the details) classmates from their
                graduation from Annapolis though the course of the Cold War. In this case, Mr.
                Little narrates the careers of two classmates from Yale who join the CIA in the
                early 50’s through the fall of the Soviet Union. In any case, I don’t necessarily
                love this plot device; it stretches the imagination too much when characters
                conveniently find themselves involved in all the key points of a given period of
                history. But the book was well written and the story kept my interest. One footnote,
                the book pays careful attention to the career of James Jesus Angleton; although when
                he exits the stage, Stacy’s father does not get a cameo appearance in the story! (In
                fact and not fiction, he assumed the role as Deputy Director for Counterintelligence
                when Angleton was relieved of his duties.)</d:para>

            <d:para>A children’s book illustrated by Chris van Allsberg of Polar Express fame. While
                written for children, Mr. Helprin does not dumb-down his writing. Like most of his
                novels, he contrasts the beautiful with the ugly, the good with the evil and the
                true with the false; but he is always more interested in the virtues than the vices.
                So rather than a castigating the wicked in an excessively moralizing tone, his prose
                attempts to rise to the perfections of the virtues. I originally bought this for
                Anna, but she was not interested in the book.</d:para>

            <d:para>Stacy gave this to me for Christmas. An outstanding biography of a loathsome
                subject. There aren't many details of Stalin's early life, but Mr. Kotkin provides
                an in depth presentation of the Russian empire in which Stalin was raised. He gives
                the best presentation of the system of "autocracy" by which the last Tsars ruled. In
                the West, we make the mistake of thinking of the Tsars as just another tyrannical
                king along the lines of Henry VIII of England or Louis XIV of France. But the theory
                of power to which Nicholas II subscribed was much closer to that of the Byzantine
                blend of religious and secular authority. (Please note that I do not use the term
                "Byzantine" in the pejorative sense, but in the actual historical sense.) Nicholas
                II opposed the radical parties that sought to remake Russia, but he also opposed
                conservative parties that sought to defend the throne. Any political party at all
                was a diminution of his power. Kotkin's description of Russia's entanglement in WWI
                is also top notch. I believe that there will be two more volumes in this biography.
                I am drawn to Kotkin's scholarship but not anxious to spend more time in Stalin's
                presence.</d:para>

                They mistake a ne’er-do-well clerk passing through town for a government inspector.

            <d:para>This book was a Christmas gift to Thomas. In grading this book, I’ve gone back
                and forth between a 4 and a 5. Mr. Swaim is a gifted writer and he has an
                interesting story to tell about his stint as a speech writer for South Carolina
                Governor Mark Sanford. Gov. Sanford's personal shortcomings provide plenty of
                material to work with, but what makes this book so interesting is Mr. Swaim’s
                attempt to understand why things happened the way the did. One of his most
                insightful observations is that in today’s world of 24 hour news coverage, the media
                expects that politicians will have some opinion on any possible subject at any
                moment in time. Of course, no one can possibly have something intelligent to say on
                everything, so politicians learn to provide expansive but meaningless answers in
                order to buy time. (Which is basically the exact opposite approach provided to
                plebes at the Naval Academy; I was taught that there were only 5 appropriate
                responses from a plebe: “Aye, Aye, sir” to respond to directions, “Yes, sir”, “No,
                sir” to answer simple queries, or the correct answer or “I’ll find out, sir” to
                requests for information.)</d:para>

            <d:para>Mr. Gladwell brings a statisticians eye into the debate between nature vs.
                nurture in the development of “genius.” While he does provide original insight into
                some “nurture” factors that are immediately apparent, in the end he offers little
                more than the recognition that “genius” is a combination of innate capability, hard
                work and external support (whether that comes from your family, school,
                neighborhood, etc.) Mr. Gladwell is an enthusiastic and entertaining writer; he
                doesn’t overwhelm the reader with too many numbers. And I did find his conclusions
                to be thought provoking. However, keeping in mind the mantra that “correlation does
                not mean causation”, I don’t think many of his examples conclusively prove the
                “causation” implied by his thesis.</d:para>

            <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">I don’t think anyone would argue that Grant
                is the greatest American; indeed many deride him as a “butcher”, a simpleton,
                incompetent and / or corrupt. But I have always been fascinated by Grant and admired
                his rise from modest circumstances. After reading this biography, I can say that if
                he is not the greatest American, he is perhaps the most fascinating. When I was
                younger, I read most of the books of Bruce Catton and he was a big admirer of
                Grant’s rise from humble origins and failure to the pinnacle of success. But his
                work largely ignored Grant’s post war career as general and president and largely
                ignored his struggles with alcohol. Thomas Buell is one of my favorite biographers,
                but he characterized Grant as a “yeoman” who achieved success by dogged
                determination despite a glaring lack of intellect and imagination. And B.H. Liddell
                Hart proclaims Sherman as the sole military genius of the Civil War with Grant
                mostly providing support and encouragement. But I think that Mr. Chernow is correct
                in his assessment of Grant as the true genius behind the successful conclusion of
                the Civil War. He was consistently aggressive throughout the war; seemingly
                untroubled by anxiety over what could possibly go wrong yet having an uncanny
                ability to sense how his opponent’s anxieties could be exploited. His Vicksburg
                campaign provided the blue print for Sherman’s campaigns in Georgia and the
                Carolinas. And while the “Overland campaign” against Lee was a bloody slog, he never
                lost sight of his strategic goal of destroying the Confederate army and Southern
                morale. Lee matched Grant’s tactical skill, but Grant dictated the pace of action in
                Virginia while at the same time coordinating action by all Union armies across the
                entire theater of conflict. While most commentators note the higher number of
                casualties suffered by the Union during this campaign, in terms of percentages,
                Grant's Army of the Potomac suffered casualties of 45% while Lee's Army of Northern
                Virginia (already much smaller to start with) suffered losses of over 50%. And in
                the end, he had the wisdom to understand how to manage Lee to achieve the surrender
                of his army rather than its dispersal into guerrilla bands. The coverage of his
                career as President is also excellent. Grant's presidency is mostly regarded as a
                failure due to a number of financial scandals by members of his administration. Yet
                Mr. Chernow highlights the many successes he achieved that have been largely
                ignored. As much as I’ve read about the Civil War, Mr. Chernow’s biography has
                demonstrated that I have a glaring lack of knowledge about the Reconstruction
                era.</para>

            <d:para>I gave this to Thomas for Christmas and read it after he was finished. Mr.
                Hari’s account of his experiences during the genocide in Darfur in the 2000’s is
                fairly brief, but as powerful as anything to be found in Solzhenitsyn. Yet for all
                of the heartbreaking details , he tells his story with a grace, charm and even humor
                that is spellbinding. Some of the language in this book is as beautiful as any prose
                I’ve read in English. I don’t know how much of the writing is his own (English is
                not his native language) or how much is from his co-authors (the title page states
                “As told to Dennis Michael Burke and Megan M. McKenna ), but my impression on
                reading it is that Burke and McKenna may have transcribed and organized his words by
                the style is his own (just a guess.) The end result is both tragic and
                beautiful.</d:para>

                5, but the plot has some holes that seem to indicate that this book was thrown
                together in a bit of a hurry. I have no idea if that is the case, but if you

                from my former alignment, the more I can recognize how often someone can rationalize
                support for a person or a policy simply because it comes from someone who shares the

                interesting than the characters in The Game of Thrones. But Mr. Jones is not in the
                same league as Mr. Martin as a story-teller. This book covers the high-lights, and
                touch on some interesting ideas - the development of English law, the evolution of
                kingship and the nobility, the increasing role of trade and banking. Mr. Jones, to
                his credit notes these issues, but the format of this book, touching on the
                highlights and lowlights of each king, leaves little room to explore them in
                depth.</d:para>

            <d:para>A good overview of the Spanish Civil War marred by Mr. Beevor’s prejudice for
                the Republicans. I doubt that anyone in today’s age could be pro-Nationalist
                (restricting the use of the term Nationalist to describe Franco’s forces). But in
                failing to treat the Republican abuses of power with the same jaundice eye as the
                Nationalists damages his credibility as an impartial reporter of the course of the
                Civil War. To his credit, he is very critical of the lack of political and military
                capability of the Republicans and he is nearly as hard on the Communists as he is on
                the Nationalists. He would have been best served to have stuck with presenting the
                facts and raising questions on alternative courses of action both sides could have
                taken (which he does quite effectively) and left the moral judgements to the reader.
                He did this much more effectively in The Fall of Berlin 1945.</d:para>

            <d:para>Tom Kalaris, Stacy’s cousin from Montana, sent us this book. The author, a
                sports writer, spent a year in Montana following the season of the girl’s high
                school basketball team in Hardin, Montana. He was drawn to this team because half of
                the squad were Crow Indians. Having spent a fair amount of time in the west as a
                child, and having relatives who have lived in Montana, Wyoming and Utah, I was
                somewhat familiar in an abstract sense of what life was like on the reservations.
                This book provides a much more detailed examination of life on the Crow reservation
                and of the complexity of the relationships between the Crow and their neighbors in
                Hardin. The author was able to learn a great deal about the girls on the team, and
                in particular of the star player - a Crow girl named Sharon. He learned so much,
                that as I read the book I wondered whether he was engaging in speculation on what
                the girls were thinking or feeling or whether he was betraying a great deal of trust
                of those with whom he lived for that year. In reading articles online, it appears
                that the second is the case. Before leaving, he had been named an honorary member of
                the tribe, but after the publication of the book, he is persona non grata among both
                the Crows and the non-native residents. But while those whose lives are examined in
                this book may feel betrayed, Mr. Colton has presented the rest of us with an
                unvarnished look at the struggles the Crows face in adapting to the modern
                world</d:para>

            <d:para>An examination of the development of the AK-47 assault rifle and its impact in
                the post Cold War world, expanded with a general examination of the development of
                automatic weapons and a detailed look at how the US military responded to this
                development. Not great, but worthwhile read for both those who are interested in
                guns and for those who does not really understand firearms. In the current debate on
                gun control and gun violence, the press tends to label any gun that resembles the
                AK-47 or the M-16 as an assault rifle without understanding the capabilities of the
                gun in question. Mr. Chivers may not explicitly state it, but this book makes clear
                that an assault rifle is one that fires a rifle round (as opposed to a pistol round)
                and that can operate in either a semi-automatic (pull the trigger, fire one bullet)
                mode or a fully automatic (pull the trigger and bullets fire until you release the
                trigger) mode. A gun firing a pistol round with the same capability to switch
                between semi and fully automatic firing is known as a sub-machine gun. Aside from
                the technical development of assault rifles, he also recognizes the tremendous
                symbolic impact of the assault rifle. So while the press may be wrong to call an
                AR-15 or AK-47 that can only fire in semi-automatic mode (the only type of which can
                legally be purchased) from a technical perspective, they have a better argument from
                perspective of the public fascination with such fire arms. </d:para>

            <d:para>When Thomas returned from the Ionian Village summer camp in Greece, his uncle
                Tom had recommend that he read this book. Tom had recently read a book called The
                Thucydides Trap; it is my understanding that this book links the events of the
                Peloponnesian War with the contemporary competition between the US and China. Not
                having read the Thucydides Trap and now having read the History of the Peloponnesian
                War, I can say that I don’t see the connection. I see a much better connection
                between this book and the events leading up to the American Civil War, or leading up
                to WWI, or even the current rise of populist movements in Europe and the US. The
                conflict in this war was an internecine affair - Greek on Greek. They spoke the same
                language, worshipped the same gods, participated in the same athletic competitions.
                A sobering illustration of how even in a common culture, selfish interests can
                override common sense and lead to terrible outcomes. Herodotus, in my opinion,
                probably offers a better comparison for US / China relations. Herodotus attempted to
                explore why two different cultures came into conflict, and why the Greeks were able
                to prevail. Like all of the Landmark versions of classic histories, this book is
                loaded with maps, footnotes and explanatory appendixes. The Landmark classics almost
                deserve a grade of 5 based solely on the quality of the production.</d:para>

            <d:para>Another one of Thomas’ text books; a collection of essays on various aspect of
                life in the Byzantine Empire. Stylistically tending to the dry and scholarly, but
                each of the essayists seemed more concerned with understanding life from the
                Byzantine perspective than trying to pigeon hole their subject into modern
                terms.</d:para>

            <d:para>Reading for Lent, didn’t finish by Easter. Better to take this book in small
                chunks than to simply power through. “We have the choice of two identities: the
                external mask which seems to be real and which lives by a shadowy autonomy for the
                brief moment of earthly existence, and the hidden, inner person who seems to us to
                be nothing, but who can give himself eternally to the truth in whom he subsists. It
                is this inner self that is taken up into the mystery of Christ, by His love, by the
                Holy Spirit, so that in secret we live 'In Christ.'”</d:para>

                body to be found. The birds may come and circle for a while... but they soon go
                elsewhere. When they are gone, the 'nothing,' the 'no-body' that was there, suddenly
                appears. That is Zen. It was there all the time but the scavengers missed it,

                of florid muck-racking journalism. Took a long time to really get going with the

                entertaining, and he remained somewhat even handed in his judgements of some of the
                main players. The chapter on the election of one of Montana’s Senators is an eye

            <d:para>Recommended to me by Nick Salafsky. An "alternate" history that imagines forces
                from the future going back in time to the Byzantine Empire of Justinian I. One force
                seeks to build in empire based in India to re-direct the course of history, another
                force enlists general Belisarius in a plot to counter the Indians. The author's try
                to imagine how the two sides would adapt to the sudden introduction of such
                technology as stirrups and gun powder. That might have made for a thought provoking
                work, but Belisarius' diplomatic / espionage journey to India veers way off into
                James Bond style action adventure. And since the authors' style resembles nothing so
                much as a Hollywood screen play, it is perhaps inevitable that they imbue Belisarius
                with a thoroughly modern outlook. But, to their credit, the book provides many
                interesting details about the external trappings and customs of the Byzantine Empire
                and ancient Ethiopia and India.</d:para>

            <d:para>A digitally scanned and OCR’ed (optical character recognition) Fairly poor copy,
                especially on pages with footnotes. I have had this in my Nook "app" for a number of

                Twain's life growing up and then serving as a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi.
                Then moves onto a nostalgic tour covering the length of the rive late in life. The
                reminiscing on his early life is pretty good; the moralizing that comes with his
                observations on his late trip is sometimes too much. I'm sorry I didn't book mark
                it, but there was one bit of unintentional irony when he talks about the 19th
                century being the most "progressive" in history. Mr. Twain had no inkling of present
                day "progressives" who brand him as a racist miscreant and who would love to consign

                his soapbox to moralize, he writing is dated and laughably out of date. So too, I
                suppose, will our own efforts be judged by future generations.</d:para>

            <d:para>Nick Salafsky lent me this book. An excellent military history of the first
                years of the Revolutionary War. He does a good job of also covering the British
                perspective. An excellent writer, he weaves in a tremendous level of detail from
                primary sources yet never seems to bog down. Here is my favorite: “Captain George
                Harris, shot in the head near the redoubt, was saved by trepanning, the boring of a
                hole in the skull to relieve the pressure from bleeding. Doctors positioned a mirror
                ‘so as to give me a sight of my own brain,’ he later wrote a cousin. ‘It may
                convince you and the rest of the world that I have such a thing.’ “ So typically
                British! The British had huge advantages in training and tactics and command of the
                sea where and when they chose. The Americans had the advantage of huge distances, a
                large population and genuine outrage at heavy handed British responses to event in

            <d:para>My third time reading this book. Read it the first time in the summer of 1990
                after I returned from my exchange program in Leningrad. If you would have asked me
                then if I would have ever read the book again, I would have said know. While I found
                the story compelling enough to finish, my feeling at the time was that I had spent
                too much time in Raskolnikov’s head and that was not a pleasant place to be. A
                number of years ago, I picked up a recorded version at the library and listened to
                it during my daily commute. This time, I read it at the same time as Anna, who had
                to read it for her English class. Just like with The Scarlet Letter, I read it so
                that we could discuss the book at dinner. This time, the translation was done by
                Pevear and Volokhonsky. This time around, I found the novel much more interesting.
                Don’t know if this is because the translation is better, or because I have a deeper
                understanding of Orthodox Christianity and can see how deeply this influenced the
                story, or because I was just slow to appreciate the some of the underlying themes.
                This time, I was also able to recognize some of the reoccurring symbols in the book
                - such as the color yellow and the contrast between the hot oppressive air of St.
                Petersburg contrasted by images of fresh air. I wasn’t keeping a book journal in
                1990, so I didn’t “grade” the book then. Don’t red:member if I recorded the time I
                listened to the recording. But upon a third reading, I can confidently say that this
                is worthy of a “five” as I am quite likely to read it again. Also, while published
                only 16 years after The Scarlett Letter, Crime and Punishment seems far closer to
                our current world view. In some ways, Dostoevsky was eerily prescient about the
                negative consequences of some of the emerging “radical” theories of socialism,
                nihilism and individualism.</d:para>

            <d:para>Mom gave this to me for Christmas. Mr. Zuckoff weaves personal narratives
                following the structure of the events of that day. Some of the accounts were
                familiar to me from the various 9/11 retrospectives on TV over the years; most were
                not. I highly recommend this to Thomas (who was too young to red:member the events)
                and Anna (who was two days from being born on 9/11).</d:para>

                that I frequently think about Thucydides and his insights on politics and conflict,
                but not sure that I would actually read the book again. In terms of “style” and the
                simple pleasures of reading, Joseph Epstein is top notch.</d:para>
