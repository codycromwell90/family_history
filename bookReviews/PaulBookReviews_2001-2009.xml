                            MacDonald has done a wonderful job compiling first hand accounts of the

                            battle. She also provides some accounts of the other service branches (
                            artillery, logistics, cavalry) and the home-front. Excellent at

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Mr. Ellis document the
                            relationships of key members of the Revolutionary Generation. He
                            profiles Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, George Washington, Ben
                            Franklin, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. The book takes
                            a somewhat original approach, neither a biography of the key figures,
                            nor a chronological recounting and analyses of the key events shaping
                            our new nation. Rather an examination of the personalities and
                            relationships among the key players. Yet it almost comes across as a
                            fluff piece; a distinguished historian "mailing one in" for a big
                            payday. But to be fair, the book did win a Pulitzer Prize, and is a good
                            general survey of one of the key periods in our history.</para>
                        <d:para>As a biographer of both Adams and Jefferson, Ellis devotes most of
                            the book to them along with a good deal of coverage to Jefferson's
                            protege, Madison. The other "Founding Brothers", Hamilton, Burr,
                            Washington, and Franklin are given more cursory examination. Indeed,
                            Burr's sole purpose in the book apparently is to give the author the
                            chance to open with a dramatic retelling of the Hamilton / Burr duel.
                            Having read Ellis' biography of Jefferson, it appears that his preferred
                            style is not to give a chronological narrative of the history, but to
                            use certain key events to provide an analysis of the impact of his
                            subjects. I think this is a very good approach when covering an area
                            such as the founding fathers, which has been gone over in almost endless
                            detail beforehand. One interesting note, while reading this, Ellis was
                            forced to apologize for making up incidents in his own personal life,
                            including service in Vietnam. Since Jefferson can, at worst be
                            considered duplicitous (see his betrayal of Adams while serving as his
                            Vice-President) or at best as a master of rationalizing his actions -
                            one wonders about the soft handed manner in which Ellis wants to believe
                            that Jefferson was capable of creating an ideal world in his head and
                            then be completely taken by surprise when caught red-handed in a lie. In
                                <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="underline"
                                >American Spinx</emphasis>, Ellis goes through to great lengths to
                            build up Jefferson's character so that he can state that he does not
                            believe the allegations of Jefferson's affair with Sally Hemmings. One
                            wonders if his almost soft treatment of Jefferson's faults stems from
                            guilt over his own misrepresentations ( but then I stoop to analyzing
                            the author through the lens of pop-psychology - a habit of many modern
                            biographers that I find unsound.) In any case, Ellis attempts to make
                            amends by acknowledging that DNA evidence has proven beyond a doubt that
                            Jefferson indeed did father Sally Hemmings children. I believe he again
                            is off the mark. My understanding of the current evidence is that the
                            DNA evidence shows that a Jefferson male did father her children, but
                            was not conclusively tied to which male.</d:para>

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">An ambitious and
                            thought-provoking re-examining of all the "common knowledge" (academic,
                            artistic, popular and otherwise,) of the First World War. The reading is
                            a bit dry, with lots of economic statistics but is very balance. It is
                            clear that Mr. Ferguson is not attempting to promote any single
                            viewpoint, but to provoke discussion. He begins the book with 10
                            questions, listed below with a summary of his conclusions:</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">1. Was the war inevitable,
                            whether because of militarism, imperialism, secret diplomacy or the arms
                            race? In short, no. Each of the above mentioned forces were countered by
                            a rising anti-militarism movement, socialism and trade union movements,
                            and the global interests of big business.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">2. Why did Germany's leaders
                            gamble on war?  The German military, diplomatic and imperial leaders
                            sensed Germany was vulnerable to encirclement by they Entente Powers. In
                            fact, Germany's federal government was weak relative to the governments
                            of the Entente powers. Population growth, percentage of population under
                            arms, fleet size and defense spending were all tilted in favor of the
                            Entente and trending in the direction of further German weakness. The
                            German leadership wasn't sanguine about their chances in 1914, but
                            figured the odds wouldn't get any better.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">3. Why did Britain’s leaders
                            decide to intervene when war broke out on the Continent? Was it to honor
                            treaty obligations to protect Belgian neutrality? Not really, this was
                            just a fig leaf. The Liberal Cabinet was generally opposed, except for
                            Lord Grey, but were persuaded to support war to prevent the Cabinet from
                            falling and allowing the Tories to rise to power. </para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">4. Was the war, as it is often
                            asserted, really greeted with popular enthusiasm?  There were big
                            crowds, yes, and many enthused with the prospect of war. But on balance
                            there were as many who greeted the outbreak of war with trepidation. Of
                            course, war brought panic to the financial markets. Mr. Ferguson argues
                            that many of the large crowds and much of the initial enlistments were
                            the result of unemployment brought on by the financial panic.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">5. Did propaganda, and
                            especially the press, keep the war going?  Propaganda was the result
                            more of "spontaneous self-mobilization by the press." Its effectiveness
                            was limited, especially in the front line. Also, the effectiveness of
                            censorship efforts was limited.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">6. Why did the huge economic
                            superiority of the British Empire not suffice to inflict defeat on the
                            Central Powers more quickly and without American intervention?  Mr.
                            Ferguson argues that the British were economically inefficient. He also
                            questions the effectiveness of the British blockade.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">7. Why did the military
                            superiority of the German Army fail to deliver victory over the British
                            and French armies on the Western Front, as it had over Serbia, Romania
                            and Russia?  The Germans were more successful in killing the enemy than
                            the Allied armies - proving the failure of the Allied strategy of
                            attrition. In the end, Germany lost because large numbers of soldiers
                            began to surrender. ( see #9)</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">8. Why did men keep fighting
                            when, as the war poets tell us, conditions on the battlefield were so
                            wretched?  "the crucial point is that men fought because they did not
                            mind fighting... For most soldiers, to kill and risk being killed was
                            much less intolerable than we today generally assume." Indeed, many men
                            actually enjoyed combat.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">9. Why did men stop fighting?
                            No clear answer - for the Germans, possibilities include the failure of
                            Ludendorf's spring offensive, increasing illness in the ranks, and
                            Ludendorf's loss of nerve and request for an armistice.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">10. Who won the peace? Trick
                            question. The US certainly came out ahead, but Mr. Ferguson argues that
                            there really wasn't peace after the Armistice ( e.g. the Russian
                            Revolution and Civil War, Russia vs. Poland, Greece vs. Turkey, Turkey
                            vs. Armenians, street fighting in Germany, etc.</para>

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Stacy gave this book to me for
                            Father's Day. We had watched a special on the NSA on the Discovery
                            Channel or History Channel based on the access the NSA had given to Mr.
                            Bamford. This book is intended to tell the story of the NSA based on the
                            author's new access and on-going research. It appears that he took the
                            relevant material from the TV special and then dumped all his research
                            on things relevant (and irrelevant) to the NSA to fill it out. My
                            judgement is that he has gathered a lot of detail, but doesn't truly
                            understand what it means. The book is poorly organized and he goes off
                            on tangents not really related to the NSA (e.g. the shoot down of Gary
                            Power's U2 and the alleged "cover up" by the Eisenhower Administration,
                            an alleged plot by the military to create a war with Cuba in the Kennedy
                            Administration). He does a good job describing how the NSA gathered
                            information during the Cuban Missile Crisis, but makes no effort to
                            examine how, or even if, the information was actually used by the
                            Kennedy administration. His use of hyperbole and superlatives is
                            extremely annoying, and his uses variation of the cliched expression
                            "pulling stray electrons from the ether" so frequently that it almost

                        <d:para>This book was lent to me by Stephen Brumbaugh. It is one of the most
                            original and thoughtful books about the Civil War that I have read, but
                            it is somewhat hard to explain just exactly what the book is about.
                            There really is no central thesis, but instead the author extensively
                            surveys primary sources to examine how Americans felt about the war and
                            how these feelings evolved. Some chapters are merely descriptive - the
                            chapters on the sack of Columbia, SC and the Grand Review at the end of
                            the war are excellent. Other chapters deal with Jackson and, especially,
                            Sherman - their view on war making and how the public interpreted their
                            impact. Some of the things I learned: That it is somewhat pointless to
                            attempt to ascribe one "cause" of the war ( e.g. Slavery or States'
                            Rights) since American's didn't see the issues laid out so starkly. Most
                            simply felt that they were inevitably swept into the war, willingly or
                            unwillingly. The competing Northern and Southern "national myths" over
                            what constituted the United States was and the individual's relationship
                            with the state ended in the triumph of the Northern view - i.e. that the
                            united Union is more important than state and individual self
                            determination. Many came to see the war as righteous; perhaps none more
                            so than the abolitionists. They tended to see the war as an opportunity
                            to sweep away the culture of slavery and re-work southern society. But
                            what is enacted by force ( the enfranchisement of African Americans) in
                            the end could only be maintained by the continuing threat of force ( the
                            occupation of the south during reconstruction.) Once society was no
                            longer willing to maintain the threat of force, there was a reaction by
                            the old power base in the south.</d:para>

                        <d:para>I received this book as a Christmas gift from Aunt Betty. This is
                            basically a fluff piece. An inside look at the 1995 season for Army and
                            Navy, culminating in the Army-Navy game. Typical sports writing - lots
                            of glowing personal stories of the athletes' struggles and triumphs,
                            etc. etc. Of course it is somewhat flattering when your alma mater is
                            getting the fluff treatment, but I think this book offers little insight
                            to graduates of either of the Academies. One major peeve - Feinstein
                            uses the clichéd description of military intelligence as an oxymoron.
                            Let's just say that in terms of overall intelligence, sports reporters
                            are hardly included in anyone's definition of the intelligentsia. </d:para>

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Lent to me by Stephen Brumbaugh,
                            a co-worker at Fannie Mae. This book is a sterling example of military
                            history. Forget Napoleon's political accomplishments and personal life
                            (unless, of course, they can be tied to the conduct of his military
                            campaigns.) Chandler examines the campaigns of Napoleon in great depth
                            to try to examine why he was such a great general; much in the manner an
                            art historian would study the techniques an artist would use in painting
                            a masterpiece. I was familiar with the general course of Napoleon's
                            career yet I never really warmed to him because of his incredible ego.
                            And possibly because my information came from British sources, who
                            generally treat Napoleon as 'The Brute.' But this book shows just how
                            brilliant a general Napoleon was in his early days, and how truly
                            dangerous he remained as the cumulative weight of egotistical blunders
                            in his political and economic policies pulled him to his ultimate
                            downfall. He is perhaps best described as the hero of a classic Greek
                            tragedy; a fascinating blend of incredible talent and blind hubris. </para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> By all accounts, Napoleon
                            possessed a magnetic personality and was a master at motivating his
                            troops. This does not explain his success. Nor did Napoleon contrive any
                            new tactical doctrines or implement technical advances to give the
                            French a decisive advantage over his opponents. His brilliance lay in
                            his logistical ability in moving his armies. He was incredibly adept at
                            partitioning his forces for increased mobility, yet moving the parts as
                            a whole, to be concentrated in the face of a confused enemy. Any one
                            part of his army could engage the enemy's full army, allowing the
                            remaining parts to be pulled back together, generally in an entirely
                            unexpected quarter. Ultimately, armies became simply too big for one man
                            to manage, given the communication technology of the day. With the
                            exception of Davout, Napoleon never developed subordinates talented
                            enough to operate independently in support of the main army. The
                            de-centralized command structure of the allies finally began to work
                            against him. While Napoleon would savage whomever he encountered, the
                            other portions of the allied army would, in turn, generally savage his
                            subordinates.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> For all Napoleon's tactical
                            brilliance, his profligate and often careless expenditure of his men,

                            his subordinates and his declining health and energy proved that his

                        <d:para>An entertaining novel ( really a novella) about a teenager "coming
                            of age" under in the old West. Written in a manner reminiscent of Cormac
                            McCarthy, but as this was written in the early 1980's, he may have been
                            writing contemporaneously with McCarthy. It really is an exciting yarn,
                            but is never fully developed given its short length. The author's idea
                            of foreshadowing seems to be frequent statements of the narrator that
                            his partner was no longer around at the time he was narrating the story
                            (to paraphrase: If me and Gallagher hadn't got lost that night, we might
                            still be riding together.) This ultimately robs the plot of some of its
                            suspense, but Mr. Farris still held my interest to the very end of the

                        <d:para>Another exciting yarn, but with greater depth of the characters. The
                            book is about a Vietnam veteran of the Marine Corps who has returned to
                            Vietnam to search for the remains of MIA's. This seemed to be a rather
                            uninteresting subject for a novel, but James Webb really brings the
                            contrast between Asia (Vietnam in particular) and the West (America in
                            particular) to life. The initial plot twist in which a body found with
                            the dog tags of a American deserter provides an interesting turn to the
                            story. The subsequent pursuit of the bad guy, however, really brings the
                            plot down to the level of a Hollywood action adventure script (maybe
                            James Webb really does have a movie in mind.) If Mr. Webb weren't such a
                            good writer, the plot would been a poor vehicle for a serious novel.
                            Personally, I would have rather had a less exciting book that explored
                            in greater detail the gradual reconciliation of Vietnam and the US and
                            its effects on the protagonists. Of all his books ( I think I have read

                            Oct. 3, 1993. Mr. Bowden does an outstanding job of weaving radio
                            transcripts and eyewitness testimony to cover the course of the battle.
                            The battle scenes are vivid and they get your heart pumping. The best
                            thing about this book is that the author tells the story and pretty much
                            leaves his opinion out of it. In this respect this is a model of what
                            journalism should be. In the conclusion, he does discuss some of the
                            controversy about whether the troops were properly supported or whether
                            we should have been chasing Aidid in the first place. The author gives
                            his take, but leaves it clear that detailed analysis of the military and
                            political aspects are best left to someone else. </d:para>

                            Foote is a novelist, and as such emphasizes the human drama of the civil

                            viewpoint, ultimately it offers little insight into the events it

                        <d:para>This is a converts guide to the Orthodox Faith. Ms. Mathewes-Green
                            chronicles one year in the liturgical life of her church, and does a
                            good job of explaining the practice and viewpoint of Orthodoxy. However,
                            she seems to suffer somewhat from the "zeal of a convert" and at times
                            she can be quite condescending in dealing with viewpoints other than her
                            own. For me, the most useful passage was the description of the Russian
                            mystics use of the "Jesus Prayer," in which the practitioner is
                            instructed to begin by reciting the prayer 3000 times a day. It is easy
                            to say that you should pray, but HOW you pray seems to make a great deal
                            of difference on its effectiveness. I will try to see if starting off
                            with a less strenuous dose of the Jesus prayer offers any benefits. </d:para>

                        <d:para> Aunt Violet had given this book to me the Christmas before she
                            passed away. Unfortunately it is not a very interesting book. Mr.
                            Sampson is a reporter, and the book reads like a very long newspaper /
                            magazine article - lots of comments from Mandela and those who know him
                            and very little insightful analysis of his impact. Overall, Mr. Sampson
                            attempts to give a balanced account, but it is easy to discern his
                            liberal viewpoint. For instance, he seems to think that the Cold War was
                            a childish spat between two superpowers, who in their ignorance, were
                            ignoring the truly important problems in South Africa. I would have
                            abandoned this book, but it did prove useful in filling in some gaps in
                            my knowledge of South Africa. I had taken a course in African politics
                            in 1989, which was dominated by discussion of the problems in S. Africa.
                            I had always wondered how a peaceful solution to the transfer of power
                            from the Afrikaners had come about - everyone was so pessimistic about
                            the odds of the actually happening in the 80s. I was also able to
                            understand Mandela's impact on the events in question. His character is
                            truly admirable, and his role in bringing about a peaceful transition of
                            power will secure his place in history. However, prior to his
                            imprisonment, his skill as a leader of the African National Congress
                            party can as best be described as unaccomplished, as can his record as
                            president of S. Africa. But Mr. Sampson treads lightly on his
                            shortcomings, as if he only wants to emphasize the humanity of this
                            secular saint of the left. Two interesting books about S. Africa,
                            although perhaps dated at this point, are <emphasis

                        <d:para> Stylistically, this book reads like a text book, but it is
                            absolutely worth the effort. Finally, someone puts the "science" in
                            Political Science, and by doing so debunks most of the myths about our
                            environment that are mindlessly circulated by the press these days. Mr.
                            Lomborg, a liberal supported of the environmental movement, set out to
                            discredit the conservative Prof. ?, who claimed that our environment and
                            overall quality of life were actually getting better. As he assembled
                            the data to refute this positive viewpoint, a funny thing happened. He
                            realized that Prof. ? was pretty close to being right. Mr. Lomborg
                            covers the entire realm of the environment and the human condition
                            (physical condition, that is) and meticulously analyzes the trends of
                            the existing data. Of course, there are plenty of problems in the world
                            today, but Mr. Lomborg argues that they are a result of poverty and not
                            a result of the developed nations exploitation of the earth / developing
                            world. Central to his argument that the propaganda of the environmental
                            movement, mindlessly reported by the press, are causing us to
                            mis-allocate resources which could most effectively be used to address
                            issues that could truly have a positive impact ( economic development /
                            education / clean water / sanitation in the developing world.) This is
                            what all political analysis should be like. </d:para>

                        <d:para>Loaned to me by Stephen Brumbaugh. Just interesting enough to keep
                            your attention, but not engrossing. Mr. Grisham seems to be a capable
                            story teller, but his characters are too shallow to be considered
                            "literary." While he is known for his lawyer stories ( none of which I
                            have read ) that are quickly turned into movies, this book is a
                            departure from his usual topics. It is set on a small farm in Arkansas
                            in the early 1950's, and describes a young boy's awakening to the world
                            outside of his rural surroundings. It is somewhat evocative of a time
                            gone by, but like any novel dealing with the south, it will inevitably
                            be compared with Faulkner. In this case, it will come up short, but it
                            is interesting enough to perhaps be an Oprah book club recommendation. </d:para>

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para> I inherited this book from Grandpa Rodine. A funny thing about
                            keeping this book log - sometimes you finish a book simply so that you
                            can pan it in your review. This is such a book. Mr. Vidal is known for
                            taking an unconventional view in his historical fiction. But in this
                            book, he isn't so much concerned about questioning the conventional
                            views of American history as he is in cynically expanding every
                            stereotype of an era which is already viewed with some disdain as a time
                            of machine politics and "robber baron" industrialists. The politicians
                            in Empire are either venal or egoists who act only to serve their self
                            interest. The newspaper men (and woman) view the buying public as a mass
                            of fools who simply wish to be stimulated with sensationalized stories
                            of little substance. The industrialists and capitalists exist only to
                            buy politicians, build mansions in Newport and travel to acquire
                            European culture. Basically, Mr. Vidal's history passes from being
                            analytical to becoming propaganda of the "every thing about America is
                            evil" school which became popular during the Vietnam war. If America
                            were truly as corrupt and selfish as depicted by Mr. Vidal, we would
                            never have been anything more than another "banana republic." From a
                            literary point of view, the characters in this book are almost entirely
                            unsympathetic (except, perhaps, for John Hay and Henry Adams.) -and are
                            more in the manner of anti-heroes. I don't think Mr. Vidal's late 20th
                            century scepticism / cynicism translates well when transplanted to an
                            early 19th Century setting. All in all, this book is an entirely
                            unbalanced depiction of the political life of the US at the dawn of the
                            20th Century. Incidentally, I can't imagine the Grandpa Rodine ever got
                            around to reading this book - its cynicism is more up Uncle Steve's
                            alley. But I don't think that Uncle Steve would like the depiction of
                            the "lifestyles of the rich and famous of 1900" any more than I did. It
                            is somewhat of a pity, given how much I enjoyed <emphasis

                            classify much of Solzhenitsyn's work as historical fiction. And given
                            his opposition to the policies of his government and his examination of
                            Russian history, there are some surface similarities between he and Gore
                            Vidal. There are some critical differences, however. Solzhenitsyn's
                            opposition to his government was the result of his exposure to one of
                            the most criminally oppressive governments in history. Gory Vidal's
                            primary motivation, with the exception of <emphasis role="underline"
                                >Lincoln</emphasis>, simply seems to be to burst the bubble of the
                            many figures whose reputation doesn't live up to his standards. Thus,
                            Solzhenitsyn's work is motivated by outrage over grave injustice, while
                            Vidal's seems to be more pique that everyone else doesn't see the world
                            the same as he does. And while Solzhenitsyn risked his life to continue
                            to publish his work and was exiled by the Soviets, Vidal fled in a huff
                            to Italy for self-imposed exile in a lovely villa on the Amalfi Coast.
                            Solzhenitsyn is a dissident, Gore is a gadfly.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> In terms of literary merit, it
                            is my opinion that Gore Vidal cannot hold a candle to Solzhenitsyn.
                            Unlike Gore Vidal's glib cynicism, Solzhenitsyn wields irony like a
                            bludgeon. One great irony is that those in the "establishment" - those
                            who administer the camp or who are involved in sending people to the
                            Gulag - are no less prisoners than those who are imprisoned. Even
                            Stalin, the great dictator, is imprisoned. Physically he is trapped in a
                            sick body and dwells within a small apartment and office the walls of
                            the fortress of the Kremlin. Mentally he is unknowingly imprisoned by
                            the sycophancy of those who server him and prevent him from seeing
                            things as they really are rather than as he wishes they would be. The
                            West, in particular the political left, doesn't escape the bludgeon
                            either. The leftist French reporter sees the "Black Maria" truck with
                            the sign proclaiming "Meat, Bread" and sees (that which he wants to see)
                            that the Soviet state is efficiently meeting the goals of socialist
                            distribution of wealth. Of course, he will never investigate enough to
                            learn what almost every Russian knows - that this is a transport of
                            prisoners.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> There is less direct allusion
                            to religion as there is in later works such as November 1916, his
                            underlying belief still is apparent. For the only people who attain
                            freedom are those prisoners who have lost everything yet learn to live
                            again as an individual in spite of their degradation. In the end, there
                            is one great final irony. That the all powerful political, intellectual
                            and artistic elite of the Soviet Union are imprisoned by the very system
                            that they have created. That those who are being crushed by the state
                            learn to live and rise above their degradation once they are stripped of
                            their old life, is a triumph. This is a triumph of the individual who
                            overcome all efforts at erasing their identity and the triumph of the
                            meek who will inherit the kingdom of God.</para>

                        <d:para> This book is meant to be a purely military history of the Civil
                            War. The author mixes in depth examinations of particular aspects of the
                            Civil War armies and navies with a narrative account of the military
                            action of the war. However, there is no coherent link between the two.
                            For instance, he begins chapter 26 with a description of the medical
                            services of each side then jumps into a blow by blow account of the fall
                            of Fort Fisher and Wilmington, NC. There is no logical link between the
                            topics. This book falls far short of the standard that Chandler set in
                            the <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="underline"

                            the Union seemed to employ their artillery more effectively than the

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">The lives of two very
                            interesting personalities are traced up to their intersection at Little
                            Big Horn. The book is thoroughly researched, a hallmark Ambrose (based
                            on those books of his that I have read), but the conclusions he draws
                            from his research are full of contradictions. Since these two figures
                            are as intertwined in public memory as Wellington and Napoleon, the
                            comparison serves for a good story. However, Ambrose tries to describe
                            every way in which these two warriors were similar. The only convincing
                            similarity is that they both possessed almost super-human courage. In
                            his depiction of Civil War generals, Ambrose makes a mistake in judging
                            their willingness to take heavy casualties. His criticism is based more
                            upon modern conceptions of what is right rather than on thoughtful
                            analysis of the weapons and tactics that evolved during the Civil War.
                            He casually uses the phrase "final solution" in describing the strategy
                            Sherman and Sheridan developed to combat the plains Indians, then spends
                            the better part of a page explaining why American policy towards the
                            plains Indians cannot be compared to "genocide" (as practiced by the
                            Nazis.) On page 444, as he summarizes the Battle of Little Bighorn,
                            Ambrose has this to say about Custer: "The attack had been a gamble, but
                            so had all his attacks. It was a good plan." Further down the same page,
                            however, he has this to say about Custer: " He often boasted that with
                            that force (the 7th Cavalry) he could whip all the Indians 'in the
                            Northwest', and he wasn't far wrong. Be he never got a chance to prove
                            it, because of his own overconfidence and inept tactics." There are some
                            fine points to this book. It does a good job of covering Custer's Civil
                            War career and is overall a very balanced account. Overall, however, I
                            felt that <emphasis role="underline">Son of the Morning Star</emphasis>

                        <d:para>Stacy gave this history of Poland to me for Christmas. I had this on
                            my list figuring it would be good source when I get around to
                            researching the Krush family history. This is a well done and
                            interesting history. While it moves in a generally chronological
                            fashion, it is not simply a listing of who ruled when and who fought
                            what battle. It does an excellent job of balancing the political,
                            economic, social and military history of Poland. Also, the author
                            doesn’t take his interpretations too seriously, realizing that history
                            is constantly being re-interpreted. This is especially nice considering
                            his history ends in the late 1970's - before the accession of John Paul
                            II (who merits mention as arch-bishop - I think of Cracow), the rise of
                            Solidarity and the ultimate collapse of the Warsaw Pact.</d:para>

                        <d:para>I started the book in 1997, and finally got around to finishing it.
                            The reason it took so long to finish was my lack of interest in most art
                            produced after about 1900. So that is where I picked up this fall, and
                            this review is probably shaded to the negative given that I just read
                            about the period in which I had less interest. In any event, Robert
                            Hughes is an excellent writer, I do not share his taste for some of the
                            more contemporary artists. The major flaw in this book, in my eyes, is
                            the weight put upon 20th century American artists. Granted, this may
                            reflect the perceived dominant influence of American art since WWII, but
                            it also reflects the period in which technical artistic achievement has
                            been nearly subsumed in the pursuit of the "original." Aside from

                        <d:para>Audio book. Covers the same ground as Suetonius' Twelve Caesars, but
                            with the perspective of a modern historian. Grant makes the point that
                            while the sometimes outrageous personal lives (e.g. Caligula and Nero)
                            get most of the attention, the emperors of Rome were burdened with
                            incredibly hard work. The popular perception of the emperors as
                            absolutely powerful (and absolutely corrupt) has been shaded by the
                            examples set by Byzantine and other eastern potentates and by European
                            monarchies that rose to absolute power following the rise of the nation
                            states. In fact, the Roman emperors were literally military dictators,
                            who ruled by the proclamation of the troops and the intimidation of the
                            Senate and the ancient Roman aristocracy. And while the Roman army was
                            sufficient to place the emperor on his throne, there evolved no formal
                            state bureaucracy to ease the burden of administering the world's
                            farthest flung empire. Caesar was a man of sufficient ability to handle
                            the crushing work load, but Grant argues that the pressure even clouded
                            his judgement sufficiently to lead him into sufficient political
                            difficulty that it resulted in his assassination. Perhaps best
                            summarizing this work is Grant's modifications of Lord Acton's epigram
                            that "power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely." Grant's
                            view that power may corrupt, but the pressure placed on one individual
                            to administer a huge empire while at the same time constantly look over
                            his shoulder at potential plotters is enough to unhinge even the most
                            able of men (or women e.g. Agrippina, wife of Claudius.)</d:para>

                            great riders, but it is woefully lacking in the technical development of
                            bike and training techniques and only marginally better in describing
                            the evolution of team tactics. I find the logistics and tactics employed

                        <d:para>This book interprets the Book of Revelation in terms of the Catholic
                            Mass. It is written by a former Evangelical minister who converted to
                            Catholicism, and describes his quest to understand the book of
                            revelation. Mr. Hahn began with the typical evangelical position of
                            looking at world events and attempting to decipher the "End times" which
                            seem to be foretold in Revelation. In the end, he feels that the point
                            of Revelation is that it reveals how to worship God and is best
                            understood in its relevance and practice in the Mass. Interesting, if a

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para>The Greek word from which the word 'heretic' is derived is
                            "haireisthai", which means "to choose". The point being that a heretic
                            picks and chooses some elements of what is true to reach a conclusion
                            that is not correct. Or, more specifically, bits of the Church's canons
                            in which they believe. I will not label Rev. Kung a heretic because that
                            word is too "loaded" in today's usage and because he continues to serve
                            a priest in the Catholic Church. But I bring this up because he
                            "chooses" only to focus on all the problems of the Catholic Church
                            through the past 2000 years. He does not believe in the pre-eminence of
                            the Pope, and he chooses to interpret the entire history of the Catholic
                            Church as a succession of power grabs by the papacy. In examining the
                            lives and characters of the Popes, it is easy to find many Popes who
                            fell short of being a 'representative' of Christ. And as with any
                            bureaucracy, it is easy to find plenty of examples of an institution
                            failing to live up to its own ideals. However, if the only measure of
                            the Catholic Church is its worldly power and prestige, to which Mr. Kung
                            develops almost his entire focus, then one would have to question how it
                            ever survived for 2000 years and how it continues to thrive in spite of
                            the many problems it has faced and continues to face. Most disappointing
                            is that Rev. Kung sinks to mere propaganda in his critique of the
                            Church. Instead of presenting and challenging points of view within the
                            Church with which he doesn't agree, he simply denigrates those who
                            oppose him. For example, John Paul's charisma is a result of his "acting
                            ability", and by implication has no basis in genuine faith, belief and
                            commitment. All in all, this book does not offer constructive criticism
                            of the Church, but instead is the bitter complaint of a man who's views
                            are not shared by the vast majority of the Church he serves.</d:para>

                            it is not very convincing. Incidentally, the title is from a quote by
                            Francis Bacon, but given there is no "translation" from the middle

                            form, the Creed was an answer to the Arian controversy in which Arius
                            argued that Christ was created by God and therefore was not "divine"
                            during his time on earth. Mr. Johnson argues against the point of view
                            which regard the Creed as being the mindless parroting of the positions
                            of a corrupt church. Instead, he believes that the Creed is a
                            fundamental explanation of what it means to be a Christian. One of the
                            more interesting ideas is that the "creation" of all that is seen and
                            unseen by the Lord is not a single event at the dawn of time, but an
                            ongoing, continuous process in which the Lord is still fully
                            participating. The book is interesting, but suffers from its dry and
                            academic style.</d:para>

                        <d:para>A scholarly exploration of life in the 1650's in colonial Maryland.
                            Robert Cole is the subject because he, like most settlers, died at a
                            young age. His children were left in the charge of a neighbor. When the
                            children reached the age of majority, they sued their protector
                            (probably just a convenient way to achieve the legal settlement of the
                            estate, according to the book). The suit records include a detailed
                            description of the running of Robert Cole's estate by his neighbor. I
                            found the description of the development of agriculture in the
                            Chesapeake region to be particularly interesting. Based on the
                            bibliographies of major figures in the book, I believe the grandson of
                            Robert Cole may be the first recorded deed holder of what is now
                            Sampson's Harbor Farm.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Basically an edited collection of radio addresses by Mr. Lewis, this
                            book forms an examination of the basic tenets of living a Christian
                            life. Mr. Lewis provides many useful analogies to try to combat the idea
                            that is very difficult to lead a Christian. life. He is also a vocal
                            defender of Christianity against the skeptical arguments by the critics
                            of Christianity. One of his chief arguments is that a Christian is
                            "adopted" by God, not just to act like Christ, but to become perfect
                            like Christ. Of course, this is goal that is impossible for humans to
                            achieve in this world, but he argues that the act of "putting on
                            Christ", or in other words, believing that you have left your old self
                            behind to live in Christ. Also included in this book are a series of
                            discussions on Christian theology. Given the difficulty of understanding
                            and explaining the Trinitarian nature of God, Mr. Lewis ability to
                            explain by analogy and example is impressive. One of his most
                            interesting arguments is that the resurrection of Christ (and those who
                            are judged worthy) is the next step in the evolution of life on earth.
                            Thus, the theory of evolution does not eliminate God (unless, I suppose
                            you believe in a strictly literal interpretation of the Book of Genesis)
                            but instead, life in Christ is the next logical (indeed the only
                            possible) next step in the evolution of mankind.</d:para>

                            Yardley is not the first American to break codes, as the title implies.
                            He was, however, the founder of what ultimately became the NSA. This
                            book is an expansion of what Mr. Kahn has written in <emphasis

                            breaking no new ground. But Yardley's life was certainly interesting.
                            His interest in solving codes and ciphers and his administrative ability
                            led him from being a clerk in the State Department to heading American
                            military deciphering / decoding in France during WWI. Although the
                            contributions of the Americans was slight in comparison to the French
                            and British, he was able to parlay his experience into the establishment
                            of a secret government office to carry on deciphering and decoding in
                            peacetime. He was the founder of the "Black Chamber", which reached its
                            zenith of accomplishment at the Washington Naval Conference in the early
                            1920's. The Black Chamber was able to break the Japanese diplomatic
                            codes, which helped the American government reach a favorable settlement
                            at the negotiating table. The Black Chamber was disbanded during the
                            Hoover Administration, and to make ends meet in the depression, Yardley
                            wrote a book about the Black Chamber. This came at tremendous cost to
                            his professional development, for the Americans and British never again
                            trusted him to serve in any capacity.</d:para>

                            settling in a fictional area of Montana that bears a strong resemblance
                            to the area where Mr. Doig grew up (not far from the Canadian border,
                            along the front range of the Rockies.) I think this is a wonderful book,
                            and gladly recommend it to anyone who would be interested. It grades out
                            below 5, however, for two reasons. First is that T<emphasis
                                xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="underline">his House of
                                Sky</emphasis> has sets a high bar of excellence that this novel
                            comes close to, but does not equal. Second, the love that the main
                            character Angus carries for Anna stretches belief at times. Angus is in
                            the end a pragmatic man, not a dreamer, so he does not seem to be the
                            kind to spend a life nursing a lost love. But if at times this love is a
                            bit farfetched, it is used to good effect by Mr. Doig to create tensions
                            that really make this novel interesting. So in the end, like most
                            movies, you are willing to suspend belief in order to enjoy the artistic
                            effect. Perhaps this wouldn't have been so bad if the cover illustration
                            hadn't given away a few of the plot twists. Anyway, I again highly
                            recommend this book and I look forward to reading the next two volumes
                            of his trilogy.</d:para>

                            excellent book. Instead of a sweeping family epic, the action of English
                            Creek is set over the span of a single summer. In terms of plot, there
                            is nothing particularly original - a boy comes of age in a period of
                            family conflict. However, Mr. Doig pulls this off masterfully. His
                            idiomatic handling of conversation is very entertaining. His scene of

                            Christmas. A monograph which attempt to identify each artillery unit
                            which saw action at the battle of Antietam. It also includes a few
                            after-action reports from Union batteries that previously had not been
                            published. The discussion of artillery tactics utilized in the battle if
                            cursory, but interesting. Both armies were in the process of
                            re-organizing their artillery to increase centralize authority and
                            increase command and control. Because the Confederates held interior
                            lines of communication, they were able to effectively concentrate and
                            shift their units to meet the Union assaults. The bulk of the Union
                            artillery, however, was on the east side of Antietam creek. From this
                            position, they could not support the infantry as well, but they were
                            able to conduct effective (at least by Civil War standards)
                            counter-battery fire. Left unexplored is examination of the question
                            about why, once he was in position with his entire army across Antietam
                            Creek the day after the battle, McClellan did not renew the assault with
                            his superior artillery force in place to directly support his
                            infantry.</para>

                        <d:para>Stacy gave a collection of C.S. Lewis writings to me for Christmas.
                            It is a parable that relates a journey of people consigned to hell to
                            visit the edge of heaven. These people meet a bus in hell, and when they
                            arrive in heaven they are afforded the opportunity to stay. Each visitor
                            is met by someone from heaven who attempts to convince them to accept
                            the love of God and to stay. What makes this book so interesting is the
                            fact that many people who are, by the standards of current society, the
                            greatest sinners (murders, etc.) are able to gain entrance to heaven
                            more easily because they are gravely aware of their shortcomings and are
                            willing to repent and give themselves over to God's love. The people who
                            have the greatest difficulty are those who posses some virtue, but have
                            distorted it beyond all recognition. For example, one visitor is a
                            possessive and controlling mother who can't accept that God's love is
                            the highest form of all love and choose to remain in hell because her
                            'love' for her son is held out as the only worthy purpose in life. So
                            too, a jealous husband feels slighted that his wife would accept the
                            love of God and not devote herself to him. Lewis' hell is not a "fire
                            and brimstone" vision of what happens those who reject God. Rather, it
                            is a drab, glum, pathetic place filled with those who maintain their
                            individuality at all costs. In the end, one is left with the impression
                            that the lights will go out in hell and it will shrink to nothingness.
                            On the other hand, Lewis seems to imply that the way to heaven is fairly
                            easy for those who are willing to submit their will to the love and
                            service of God. For whatever is sacrificed is returned many times
                            over.</d:para>

                and were hard to put down. For non-fiction, I will choose <emphasis

                    Christianity</emphasis>, and probably also pick it as my overall book of the
                year. This is in part a defense of Christianity in an age which seems to value
                scientific inquiry as the highest form of truth. Lewis argues that the modern mind
                begins with observation and constructs truth from the bottom up. In contrast, he
                suggests that the truth and goodness have a single, overriding source. In effect,
                the modern man misses the forest for the trees. Next, the book moves into an
                examination of what Christianity is all about and how it relates to the individual
                in the modern world. Stacy and I are already beginning to read this together in the
                New Year.</d:para>

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">An entertaining,
                            thought-provoking, but ultimately self-centered memoir by a former CIA
                            officer. Mr. Baer seems to have been an extremely energetic and
                            effective operator, primarily in the Middle East and South and Central
                            Asia. His examination of the CIA's retreat from human intelligence in
                            favor of technological solutions (and an emphasis on political survival
                            in Washington at the expense of effectiveness overseas) is particularly
                            poignant in light of the intelligence failures that led to the September
                            11 attacks and the misunderstanding of Saddam Hussein's capabilities and
                            intentions with regards to weapons of mass destruction. This book
                            reminds me very much of Rogue Warrior, Richard Marchenko's memoirs of
                            his carrier in the Navy Seals. They both express the frustration of a
                            true operator in an environment ultimately controlled by bureaucrats.
                            They are able to elaborate on the shortcomings of the bureaucrats. But
                            their only solutions seem to be for those in Washington to stand aside
                            and let the operators do their job. And given the presumed competence of
                            Mr. Baer and Captain Marchenko, that may seem like a good idea. But what
                            happens when the operator is Oliver North, someone gifted in initiative
                            but lacking in training in covert operations and understanding of the
                            political consequences of his actions? In real life, the mistakes of the
                            Oliver Norths' of the world give the bureaucrats the ammo they need to
                            increase their power at the expense of the operators. This is really an
                            interesting problem, and one that occurs repeatedly in history. Billy
                            Mitchell was court-martialed for being too outspoken is his advocacy for
                            a new way of warfare. The Admiral who launched a surprise air attack on
                            Pearl Harbor in a war game is told that his actions are not reasonable
                            by the "battleship" drivers running the Navy. Patton languishes in
                            nondescript posts in peace time, bidding his time until the next war.
                            Meanwhile, Washington goes about its business with little fore site of
                            what is to come. Given the general optimism of Americans in particular
                            and people in general, I think it is impossible to predict many of the
                            turns of history brought about by some very bad people, but hindsight
                            continually shows that we are left to scramble in reaction to unexpected
                            events.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> Mr. Baer's great weakness is in
                            his descriptions of how Washington works. Given his focus on the Middle
                            East, he seems to think that the oil lobby owns Washington. And he is
                            able to point to the very many in Washington who feed at the trough of
                            the oil lobby. But he doesn't seem to see that the politicians have
                            numerous other troughs at which to graze - the Israel lobby, the medical
                            industry, the defense Industry, the banking and insurance industries,
                            etc. etc. etc. Mr. Baer shows that he is very focused on his area of
                            expertise, but somewhat lacking in where it fits into the "big picture."
                            This left me quite unhappy with the current state of the intelligence
                            community as described by Mr. Baer, but not trusting his recommendations
                            of how to make things better.</para>

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">The memoirs of a UH-1 Huey pilot
                            in Vietnam. Mr. Mason is a very good story-teller and his book was
                            enjoyable to read. As a work of history, perhaps it is somewhat
                            problematic, but the book does convey the stress and danger the
                            helicopter pilots faced in Vietnam. The problematic point is his use of
                            narrative. Perhaps he really has the memory to recall word-for-word
                            conversations from 15 years in his past. But my assumption is that these
                            conversations were embellishments for the sake of improving the flow of
                            the book. That being said, this would be a tremendous book for any
                            combat helicopter pilot to read, for the action scenes are vivid and
                            gripping. There are a number of interesting angles to this memoir. The
                            overall negative view towards the war and the Army bureaucracy are a
                            reminder of the bitterness many felt about Vietnam into the early 1980s.
                            This book was written before the dedication of the Vietnam War Memorial
                            and the widespread reconciliation of many Vietnam veterans and the
                            general public that has occurred in the years since. There also seems to
                            be a much different outlook from those who served with Mr. Mason and
                            those with whom I served when I was in the Navy (early 1990s). The
                            apparent lack of knowledge that the Army Airborne units had about the
                            environment in which they would be serving are particularly telling. And
                            the pilots spent a considerable time complaining about the lack of flack
                            vests. Contrast that to today's military in which soldiers and their
                            families are quick to invest their own money on equipment that will
                            improve their safety or even their own comfort. And of course, the
                            military seems to do a much better job of selling the purpose of service
                            in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq than they did in Vietnam.</para>

                            loss of how to properly summarize its contents. C.S. Lewis has the
                            ability to explain things very simply and he has the ability to sustain
                            discussions on a very high intellectual plain. This book is mostly an
                            example of the latter approach, and as such, reading this book is hard
                            work. Difficult as the reading is, its argument for the existence of God
                            in answer to atheism's most potent challenge to religion (if God is all
                            powerful and all good, how can he allow bad things to happen to people)
                            is greatly beneficial to the believer.</para>

                            in a newspaper article on the clash between religion and secularism in

                            Sept. 13, 2001, calling the September 11 attacks by Islamist terrorists
                            "the ultimate faith-based initiative." The release went on: "Religion is
                            not the answer, it is probably the problem." And: "Prayer had its chance
                            on September 11 and it failed." September 11 "should have clinched the
                            idea this is a naturalistic universe," group leader Mr. Barker says. "To
                            stand by and do nothing makes God an accomplice. If He exists, why are

                            if you follow the logic of initial comment (calling terrorism the
                            ultimate faith-base initiative), then any group may be judged by the
                            actions of any member of that group. For instance, doctors could be
                            labelled as accomplices in genocide because a few of their numbers
                            performed horrific "experiments" on the inmates of the Nazi
                            concentration camps in WWII. The subsequent comments, while couched in
                            somewhat inflammatory manner, come closer to summarizing the central
                            problem which C.S. Lewis addresses in <emphasis role="underline">The
                                Problem of Pain</emphasis>. This dilemma certainly receives wide
                            play, as witnessed by the quote above and by occasional discussions in
                            the press in the wake of the tsunami affecting south Asia at the end of
                            last year.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> In summary, at least to the
                            best of my ability, both the secularist and the Christian accept that at
                            some point, the Universe was created. Obviously the Christian believes
                            that God created the Universe and man is one of his creatures. However,
                            the creator is not a puppet master, but instead has provided his
                            creatures with free will. There is no obvious benefit to the Creator to
                            make simple automata who worship him because they are programmed to do
                            so. With the endowment of free will, of course, comes the risk that we
                            will choose to forget, ignore, or even hate our creator. But, of course,
                            we can also choose to love and honor him. And the more we grow and the
                            more we love, the more love and glory is reflected back to the one who
                            created us. This is were the analogy of God as the father is so
                            intuitive. Think to our own example as parents. We treasure our children
                            when they are helpless infants, loving them and secure that they love us
                            if only because they know no other. Yet who would wish that their
                            children to always remain in this infant state? There is tremendous
                            satisfaction in watching your children grow and become capable
                            individuals, and the ultimate reward of the parent is when a fully
                            mature child returns the love of the parent not out of duty, but out of
                            a mature decision to continue loving.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> And so, accepting that mankind
                            is free to choose their own course in life, we have to understand there
                            are going to be those who choose not to believe in God, those who choose
                            to love themselves to the exclusion of anything else or those who choose
                            to do what everyone accepts is wrong simply because they can. We must
                            even understand that some will choose to pervert the very teachings of
                            religion to do harm to others. But, if we have free choice, (and those
                            who argue that the universe is solely "naturalistic" must accept this
                            too) then God cannot intervene to prevent evil because then Man would
                            have no free choice. We would be good not because we choose to be but
                            because we are compelled to be and therefore we would be reduced to
                            simple robots.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> Apparently (and observably),
                            even those who do not believe in God believe in right and wrong. In the
                            example above, Mr. Baker utilizes our outrage at a brutal and senseless
                            act an argument that the we exist in a naturalistic universe. But if the
                            universe is truly naturalistic, then why should we be outraged? After
                            all, do we condemn the wolf for devouring the flock of sheep? No, we are
                            outraged because it is obvious, both to believer and unbeliever, that a
                            grave wrong has been done. And if there is wrong, then there must also
                            be right. In moral terms, right and wrong do not exist in nature but are
                            clearly apparent to humans. If we can't extrapolate what is morally
                            right and what is morally wrong from a system that is amoral, then where
                            does morality come from? For the believer, the answer is clear, it comes
                            from the Lord God, the creator of the universe and the source of
                            absolute truth.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> Based on my first reading of
                            The Problem of Pain, that is my best summary of Mr. Lewis' main thesis.
                            But the obvious question is what about those killed by the tsunami? What
                            does free choice have to do with natural calamity? In short, my answer
                            to this question is that death is the ultimate tragedy if you don't
                            believe that there is anything after death. While the sheer scale and
                            suddenness of the death inflicted was stunning, the fact that over
                            100,000 people died in a matter of minutes does not change the fact that
                            those 100,000 people were going to die some day. Whether you die in few
                            moments of terror, or after months of agonizing illness or even in your
                            sleep without any suffering, death is inevitable. If you have no faith
                            in God, perhaps then it is tragic that some are cheated of the full
                            measure of life. Our modern society's great success in extending life
                            has had the unintended consequence of increasing the anxiety in facing
                            death. Instead of being grateful for the blessing of more time with
                            those we love, like addicts we long for more. We also, perhaps have
                            become too proud. A great deal of human time, energy an effort are
                            poured into medical research. The steady success over the last 150 years
                            of history in extending the length and quality of life is certainly
                            commendable, but the fact remains that every living creature born into
                            this world is going to die. Faith in God, however, brings the
                            recognition that death is the start of the next stage of life, as surely
                            a birth is the next stage of life for the unborn child. And whether you
                            die early or die late, the next stage of life will be more fulfilling
                            than this. The Problem of Pain does not just cover death, but of all
                            suffering, both of humans and of animals. If death can be accepted as
                            the next natural step, then what is the purpose of suffering? This is
                            certainly a thorny question which I will leave until I have opportunity
                            to read this book again.</para>

                        <d:para>The third installment of the McAskill Trilogy. This story takes
                            place in 1989, the centennial of Montana's statehood. The story involves
                            Jick McAskill driving his daughter Mariah (a photographer) and her
                            ex-husband Riley (a reporter) around Montana in a Winnebago to cover the
                            centennial celebrations. Perhaps Mr. Doig's greatest weakness as a
                            writer are in his plots. I find that his efforts at turning the action
                            to generate conflict amongst his characters is always a bit contrived.
                            And, as far as his characters are involved, Mariah McAskill is perhaps
                            the lease believable. And as the capstone of the family saga, there are
                            many ties back to the earlier novels which are not exactly necessary.
                            But having presented my criticisms first, this book was a joy to read.
                            It is perhaps best likened to a movie in which the plot is a bit hokey,
                            but in which the actors have a great chemistry. I consider Mr. Doig an
                            absolute master at dialog, and most of his characters are believable and
                            fully fleshed and he is able to convey a great sense of landscape
                            without using any pictures. I don't know if I will ever read this book
                            again, but I heartily recommend it as a very interesting read.</d:para>

                            serve as a sort of "graduate" level course in Christianity. I retrieved
                            the following article, dated Friday, 23 July, 1999:</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">"Regular attendance at religious
                            services has been shown to decrease death rates among old people. While
                            churchgoers would say they are expecting eternal life, science has
                            demonstrated that they seem to be extending their stay in the mortal
                            plane. A large US study found that religious folk had lower blood
                            pressure, less depression and anxiety, stronger immune systems and
                            generally cost the health-care system less than people who were less
                            involved in religion. The research looked at 4,000 old people from North
                            Carolina, and found that of the 1,177 who died during a six-year period,
                            22.9% were frequent church attenders, compared with 37.4 who were
                            infrequent attenders. Similar results were produced by the University of
                            California at Berkeley in a study of some 5,000 people aged 21 to 65.
                            Those who attended religious services at least once a week had a 23%
                            lower risk of dying over the 28 years on which the research was based.
                            Dr Harold Koenig, from the Duke University Medical Center, said:
                            'Participating in religious services is associated with significant
                            health benefits in elderly people, even when you take into account the
                            fact the religious people tend to start out with better health practices
                            and more social support.' The researchers have a number of theories as
                            to why longevity may be next to Godliness. They believe that those
                            closely involved in church life would have a larger social network, and
                            hence more social support. In addition, lower levels of depression are
                            known to have a wider health benefit. In addition, religion provides a
                            coping mechanism for stressful events or physical illness. Devout
                            worshippers are far less likely to fall back on harmful habits such as
                            drinking or smoking. Dr Koenig said: 'Such positive feelings may
                            counteract stress and convey health effects, like enhanced immune
                            function, that go far beyond the prevention of depression and other
                            negative emotions.' Biblical precedents:  Of course, those attending
                            church would say that long life has its precedents in the Christian
                            religion. After all, Noah is said by the Bible to have lived to the ripe
                            old age of 950, despite all the stress associated with surviving a
                            world-wide flood. Abraham and his wife Sarah apparently lived to 175 and
                            127 respectively. However, the strain of leading the Jewish people out
                            of Egypt and across the desert took its toll on Moses - he lived to only
                            120." </para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> I had read another article
                            describing the same study posted on a bulletin at church (St. George's)
                            last fall. What struck me was not the specific health benefits of church
                            attendance, but the lengths to which the doctors went to explain the
                            benefit without stating the obvious. Everyone I know goes to church to
                            be closer to God, not to extend their life on earth. Therefore, an
                            obvious hypothesis would be that a longer life would be a blessing from
                            God. </para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> This ties directly to the
                            central tenet of <emphasis role="underline">Miracles</emphasis>. Mr.
                            Lewis argues that the modern "naturalist" simply assumes God out of the
                            equation when examining the world around themselves. (In this sense, a
                            naturalist is one who believes that the sum total of reality exists in
                            and of itself. Also by definition, the supernatural does not refer to
                            superstitious beliefs and a rejection of science, but to the belief that
                            a supreme being is the creator and the framework of reality / nature).
                            Little time is spent in examining miracles, but most of the discussion
                            is aimed at proving that the supernatural view of things is more logical
                            and more likely correct. Miracles then can be viewed not as the
                            imaginings of the deluded faithful or the "deus ex machina" intervention
                            of a bad novelist. In fact, Mr. Lewis rejects the supposition of "God
                            the watch-maker" who created nature and disappeared from view. Miracles
                            instead are part of the natural order because not only is God the
                            creator, he is also the framework and sustainer of nature.</para>

                        <d:para>A short and concise history of the battle of New Orleans. The
                            coverage of the battle is fast and interesting, but I suspect somewhat
                            overblown. I do not get the sense that Mr. Remini is a serious scholar
                            of military history. And his effort to place the battle in the context
                            of American history is especially overblown. His contention the New
                            Orleans was America's first military victory can only be accepted if one
                            believes that American history started at the end of the Revolutionary
                            War. A big problem with many history books today is that the writers
                            seem more intent on writing a magazine article than a book of
                            scholarship. The story is more important than the context and the whole
                            piece can be summed up in some ridiculous superlative (e.g.. a subtitle
                            stating X, which change the course of history or Y, which changed the
                            world as we know it.) But for all that, the setting and the
                            personalities involved in this battle do lend themselves to a very
                            interesting story.</d:para>

                        <d:para>The subject is interesting, the conflict between small ranchers and
                            big cattle "outfits" in Wyoming in the 1890's. Events led to a brief
                            flare up of violence that is known as the "Johnson County War." This
                            book checks in at 285 pages - a good editor could have cut that in half.
                            For instance, Ms. Smith spends the first page and a half explaining how
                            the river running through the middle of Johnson County is known as
                            "Powder River", not "the" Powder River. The book held my interest
                            because I traveled through some of this area as a child when visiting my
                            grandparents in Wyoming.</d:para>

                            doing well. I just finished "Running Money" this week. I got it from the
                            library, but was able to find it at a used book store. I agree with his
                            theory that the measure of trade deficits are now irrelevant. In fact,
                            he probably hasn't gone far enough in questioning government economic
                            statistics (for example, inflation statistics are weighted to the items
                            produced in the "old" manufacturing economy versus "new" technological
                            innovations. And he only touches upon the efficiency gains provided by
                            the use of technology in conventional business.) Additionally, beyond a
                            surplus of intellectual capital, America offers unmatchable political
                            stability. We have the world's second oldest representative government
                            (behind Britain) and we have never adopted inefficient socialist
                            economic models. As bad as the stench of corruption may be from inside
                            the beltway here in Washington, our politicians are angels compared to
                            their counter parts in Tokyo, Beijing, Seoul (or even Paris, for that
                            matter.) </para>

                            Korea, with an economy dependent upon low margin manufacturing and
                            geographical located next to menacing neighbors, the US economy offers
                            the best of both worlds. The stock market provides access to higher
                            returns (and higher risk) from "intellectual property" companies and
                            Treasury securities offer perhaps the world's safest possible
                            investment. </para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> Even at Fannie Mae, a company

                            emphasis is placed on attracting foreign investors. Fannie Mae and
                            Freddie Mac have created the market for financial securities backed by
                            mortgages that they buy. Since these companies guaranty the timely
                            payment of their securities and everyone believes that the government
                            would never allow either company to fail, an investment in their
                            mortgage backed securities is almost as attractive as a Treasury note to
                            foreign investors. So by selling more mortgage backed securities, these
                            companies can buy more mortgages from banks, who in turn can lend more
                            cheaply to consumers, who can buy bigger houses which they fill with
                            products manufactured in China / Taiwan / Korea.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> The other interesting question,
                            which Andy Kessler leaves unasked, is what could possibly disrupt this
                            beneficial cycle. By implication, his review of the progress of the
                            Industrial Revolution implies that the center of the industrial economy
                            has simply migrated to find the cheapest wages. Yet for quite some time
                            after the US began to supplant English supremacy in manufacturing,
                            London remained the center of the financial world. It was the political
                            upheaval wrought by WWI which transferred financial power from London to
                            New York. From 1914 - 1917, almost all the gold in England and France
                            came to America in exchange for wheat and iron and munitions to support
                            the war effort. From 1918 onward, our economy has been the only one
                            capable of driving global economic activity the way Britain did during
                            the Industrial Revolution. So I imagine it would take another such
                            upheaval to knock the American economy off its perch - terrorists
                            detonating a nuclear device in New York, a Chinese attempt to occupy
                            Taiwan followed by protracted conflict with the US, or some similar
                            event which no one can anticipate.</para>

                            read this book because I increasingly feel alienated by marketers'
                            attempts to sell me on what I need. But this book delivered little
                            useful information on how marketers attempt to manipulate their targets
                            in order to "set the hook" and a great deal of typical academic
                            invective against a capitalist society. The area in which we share a
                            common interest, however, is in deploring the fact that advertising has
                            gone beyond the pale in moral terms. Dr Shchor's prescriptions,
                            naturally enough from an academic (you could also substitute the word
                            elitist here,) whose institution is dependent upon Federal money, is for
                            more government intervention. If you read between the lines, however,
                            the simplest solution is to simply turn off your TV. The bottom line
                            seems to be if the parents are first and foremost materialists, then the

                                Problem of Pain</emphasis> - his personal suffering did not allow
                            such detachment. It is interesting to note, that as he struggled with
                            his grief, he attempted to combat his suffering with his intellect. It
                            is also interesting to compare this book with the Book of Job. Job
                            rejects the theological explanation for his suffering presented by his
                            friends that all suffering is God's judgement. So too did C.S. Lewis
                            reject any pat comfort in suggestions that Joy's death was part of God's
                            plan, or that his suffering would make him stronger / better. In the
                            end, man's intellect cannot grasp God's infinite wisdom and those who
                            suffer are left to surrender to God's will with the understanding that
                            time will heal wounds and that will better understand God's will in the

                            someone like myself who knew little other than about the life, and a
                            little more about the reputation. For a better review, please read the
                            following by John Peter Kenny from First Things:</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">"Augustinophobia, the fear and
                            loathing of Augustine, is a long-standing malady. The condition has
                            never been confined only to the secular despisers of Christianity.
                            Indeed, in this century, symptoms have been observed among theologians
                            as well as anti-theologians. This is not really surprising. Having been
                            the universal template of Latin Christian theology down through the
                            centuries, it was inevitable that Augustine would become a touchstone of
                            opprobrium as theological and cultural fashions shifted. In many
                            respects it has been modern theologians who have been hardest on him,
                            projecting him as the grim Patriarch of Latin Christendom,
                            pathologically obsessed with sex, championing an ascetical dualism
                            rooted in misogyny, and consigning unbaptized infants to eternal
                            perdition.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">To write on Augustine with any
                            balance, or even sympathy, requires considerable independence. Peter
                            Brown did so thirty years ago in his famous biography, although that
                            effort succeeded splendidly in part because Brown used Augustine to
                            paint a pointillistic image of his age. But the Augustine who emerged
                            was more a late antique figure, and less a theologian. Even so, Brown
                            was able to recover a vivid actor on the stage of late Roman life, whose
                            insolent genius as a rhetorician brought him from the edge of the Sahara
                            to the height of the Imperial Court. For such a finely wrought story,
                            many were willing to leave aside the dreary struggle over Augustine's
                            theological positions.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Garry Wills is very much in the
                            Brown tradition. And we should be grateful to him for supplying in this
                            short 'Penguin Life' a delightful and insightful introduction to
                            Augustine. As in Brown, the great spaces and dazzling light of Roman
                            North Africa emerge, along with the agonized ambition of this provincial
                            prodigy, whose relentless rise to conspicuous success ends with his
                            momentous conversion. And what a perplexing event that is. Born of a
                            pagan father and Catholic mother, in an area heavily populated by
                            members of the Donatist sect, Augustine spent most of his early
                            adulthood as a devotee of Manicheism, a Christian heresy. This phase
                            ended when he discovered the most powerful intellectual tradition of
                            late antiquity, pagan Platonism. Yet in forsaking Manicheism, he became,
                            not a pagan Platonist, but a Catholic Christian. And not just a
                            comfortable lay member - as his mother and family entourage expected -
                            for he insisted on rejecting the easy path of marriage to a Catholic
                            heiress in favor of a life of asceticism.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">To make sense of this trajectory
                            across so remote a cultural landscape requires great insight into time
                            and place and character. Wills offers much to his reader, bringing some
                            impressive detective work to bear on many of the puzzling details of
                            Augustine's story. He is especially concerned to refute some of the
                            charges against Augustine, especially in reference to his sexual
                            adventures, which, in Wills' recounting, emerge as far less bizarre and
                            lurid than in some of the more imaginative accounts. The two mistresses
                            and the love child are still there, but against the context of Roman
                            sexual mores, Augustine's story is more ethically intelligible. This is
                            the great strength of the book: its author's consistent effort to probe,
                            contextualize, and judiciously assess.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">That said, there are two
                            shortcomings that bear mention: one minor, the other more serious. The
                            misdemeanor is the sometimes eccentric revisionism that Wills brings to
                            the names and players in this story. Never content to use the standard
                            tags, Wills transposes and, when it seems necessary, invents. Thus
                            Adeodatus, Augustine's son, becomes "Godsend," Romanianus is now
                            "Romanian," an unnamed friend whose death Augustine mourned becomes
                            "Amicus," the sole mistress of much of his early life is called "Una,"
                            etc. Nor are the standard titles safe: Soliloquies is now Dialogue with
                            Myself, while Confessions becomes The Testimony. Admittedly Wills often
                            has a valid caveat to record, yet the undergraduate instructor in me
                            dreads the inevitable confusion all this will cause the introductory
                            readers for whom this volume is designed.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">A larger issue is signaled by
                            the transition from Confessions to The Testimony. Wills wants to remove
                            any sense of either criminal confessing or penitential admission of
                            sins, preferring to view Augustine as underscoring his witness to God
                            through the title. Fair enough. But the promise of this revision goes
                            unfulfilled, in large measure because Wills persists in underplaying the
                            theological ideas that drive Augustine's inventive act of
                            autobiographical witness.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">However translated, Augustine's
                            story is not just a personal testimony, but a performative act of
                            self-abnegation. Augustine contrasts very sharply the presumption of the
                            pagan Platonist sages, who are assured that salvation can be achieved by
                            personal initiative, with the Christian admission that no salvation is
                            possible except through divine mediation. That is the act of confession
                            which Augustine uses to explain his need to become an orthodox
                            Christian, and then to write about it for all to hear. This act is thus
                            the rooting out of superbia, the pride that occasioned the soul's fall.
                            It is the initial remedy for original sin. Unlike the pagan Platonists,
                            who presumed to reverse the soul's captivity in the body by the practice
                            of philosophy, Augustine saw that only a continual oblation of the
                            soul's self-love, under the influence of grace, would bring about its
                            restoration. "Testimony" is too thin a conception to grasp the central
                            theological force of Augustine's title.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">This is a microcosm of the
                            larger issue in Wills' book - its lack of attention to the motive force
                            of theological ideas. The dogmas of a now quiet past may seem remote,
                            but they must be made to reverberate again with the katabatic forces
                            that drove Augustine's soul across the religious landscape of late
                            antiquity. This Wills simply fails to do. Manicheism, that strange
                            dualism of Persian origin, is hardly explained. And Platonism, the key
                            to Augustine's stunning shift from Manichean materialism to Christian
                            mysticism, is largely ignored. But Augustine without theology is like
                            Mozart without the music. Granted that Wills takes us through the main
                            biographical twists and turns with skill. But the theological ideas are
                            never fully engaged, nor are the awesome stakes - as Augustine
                            understood them - explored.</para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">We are left, then, with a tale
                            that fails to offend, and may even engage the reader who is intrigued by
                            this late Roman witness to the Empire's collapse. Wills has succeeded in
                            making it difficult for the contemporary reader to hold Augustine's
                            iniquities against him. But he has also, in his neglect of theology,
                            foreclosed any real opportunity to comprehend those visionary insights
                            into the divine and the eternal that mattered most to Augustine, and
                            stamped Western Christendom with his intense transcendentalist

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">This probably should have been
                            entitled "George Washington in 1776." It is a fast paced account of the
                            military action directed by General Washington against the British.
                            There is actually more coverage of British parliamentary politics in
                            this period than details of the Continental Congress' declaration of
                            independence. I can't say that I learned much from this book, and it is
                            somewhat disappointing that a noted historian would publish such a
                            light-weight book (a cynic would say he was looking for a nice payday
                            from a best-seller.) It also touches upon a pet-peeve of mine regarding
                            the history of the Revolutionary War - namely that historians seem to
                            run out of steam around 1778 or 1779 only to wake up with the Battle of
                            Yorktown and the Treaty of Paris. I would really like to read a book
                            entitled "1780" or "1781". But, with all its short-comings, the book is
                            enjoyable to read and would serve as an good introduction to the
                            Revolutionary War for someone who know little about the subject.</para>

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">I came to St. Augustine's
                            "Confessions" after reading Gary Wills' biography. For a number of
                            years, I have been encountering St. Augustine indirectly in various
                            works of history or apologetics. However, the prospect of diving into
                            any of the philosophers of old is generally a daunting proposition. But
                            I must say, that while St. Augustine's thinking is often on an elevated
                            plane not generally encountered in daily life, he has a very personal,
                            almost friendly style of writing. In the present age in which
                            informality is the norm and any reference to God is either avoided at
                            all costs or handled in a detached manner that does not leave the
                            impression that the author is anything other than a high-minded scholar,
                            St. Augustine's unceasing and heartfelt prayers to God in the course of
                            his narrative are striking. This is not a study of God from afar, but
                            the recollections of a sinner brought back to the flock. In a way, it is
                            as if a fish were recounting how the fisherman reeled him in. After his
                            conversion, Augustine proceeds to examine God's role in the world
                            through the interpretation of the Creation contained in Genesis.
                            Although written long after his conversion, it is as if Augustine is
                            examining a newly created world after his birth as a Christian. This is
                            much more difficult reading than the story of his conversion, but it
                            should leave no doubt that Genesis should not be read literally as the
                            account of creation, as some fundamentalist or Darwinists would hold.
                            This book bears a closer reading at a later date.</para>

                            history of the war in the Pacific during WWII. William Manchester is an
                            excellent writer - <emphasis role="underline">American Caesar</emphasis>
                            is one of my favorite biographies. <emphasis role="underline">Goodbye
                                Darkness</emphasis> is well written and compelling. After covering
                            his childhood, he intersperses the coverage of his service with coverage
                            of the Pacific War and with descriptions of his travels to the
                            battlegrounds as he prepared to write the book. His historical
                            background and descriptions of the battles are excellent. His depictions
                            of the places he visited are mostly interesting, but episodic. The great
                            weakness of this book is his treatment of his own service. When I first
                            started reading this book, I read the account of his childhood up to
                            Pearl Harbor. I don't remember many details, other than his father's
                            service in the Marines in WWI and the devastating blow of his father's
                            death. Mostly, I thought that he was pretty full of himself and I set
                            the book aside for a year or two. But after reading a number of accounts
                            of how good a book this was, I came back to it. What I find so
                            unappealing about his memoirs is an unremitting sense cynicism. Granted,
                            he has earned the right to be cynical, having survived two wounds and
                            some horrific combat on Okinawa. Yet, given the fact that this book was
                            written in the late 70's, following Vietnam, you get the sense that he
                            shared America's crisis in confidence. I used to think that cynicism is
                            the refuge of idealists who are tired of being disappointed, but I think
                            it is more accurate to say that cynicism is the armor worn by those who
                            are afraid to believe. For instance, he is somewhat proud of a native of
                            Guadalcanal who was recognized as an honorary a non-commissioned officer
                            for his service to the Americans during the battle. He donned his
                            uniform in honor of meeting Mr. Manchester, yet Manchester was too
                            embarrassed to admit that he had thrown away all of his own uniform
                            except for a cap. He admits to being a devote follower of FDR, yet says
                            he is an FDR liberal almost as if he is embarrassed by the fact.
                            Complementing his cynicism is a certain intellectual arrogance. He takes
                            a great deal of pride in having been a sergeant and not an officer, as
                            if it somehow kept him closer to the "common man." Finally, to the
                            mixture of cynicism and elitism, he throws in plain old 1970's bad

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Stephen Ambrose's account of the
                            building of the intercontinental railroad. Ambrose, as he usually does,
                            focuses on the heroic achievements of individuals and groups of
                            individuals. This is perhaps the major theme of every Ambrose book I
                            have read - <emphasis role="underline">Undaunted Courage</emphasis>,
                                <emphasis role="underline">Normandy</emphasis>, and now this book.
                            And just like with <emphasis role="underline">Undaunted
                                Courage</emphasis>, he picks a grand canvass on which to paint - the
                            taming of the American West. He does a good job pointing out much of the
                            anti-capitalist propaganda associated with the building of the
                            transcontinental railroad by the Central Pacific and Union Pacific
                            railroads while not shying away from the occasionally breathtaking
                            corruption of these two corporations. Yet the end result of the
                            completion of the railroad was of great benefit to the whole nation and
                            was both and economic and emotional boon to a country just emerging from
                            the Civil War. Mr. Ambrose provides excellent coverage of the men (both
                            management and workers) who built the railroads and the engineering and
                            organizational details that made the completion of the railroad
                            possible. He is less clear, however, when describing the financing that
                            allowed the railroad to be built. Either he didn't think the subject
                            that important or else he (or the editors) felt that people would be
                            bored. This omission, however, means that this book makes an exciting
                            story but a flawed historical account.</para>

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">G. K. Chesterton's personal
                            exposition of why he is Christian and why he is an 'orthodox' Christian
                            (Roman Catholic, although this is never mentioned in the book). Like
                            C.S. Lewis (who was a generation younger), Chesterton began his
                            intellectual career as an atheist, but converted to Christianity early
                            in adulthood. And it is easy to see the influence of Chesterton on
                            Lewis, although their styles are markedly different. Using a military
                            analogy, Lewis is like a careful infantry officer - carefully studying
                            the terrain, ensuring his flanks are protected and concentrating
                            artillery when preparing to attack. Chesterton, however, is a cavalry
                            officer, dashing here an there around the battlefield, striking hard and
                            then quickly moving on to another objective. Perhaps the central tenet
                            of Orthodoxy is the argument that reason and intellect unchecked are
                            very harmful to man (as an individual and as a society). In one chapter,
                            he describes madness not as irrationality but rationality taken to its
                            ultimate limit. Whether you accept this or not, this chapter clearly
                            foreshadows to disasters that fell upon mankind in the early and middle
                            20th century when the secularist and "scientific" Socialist and Fascist
                            movements wreaked unprecedented destruction upon mankind. Yet for his
                            astonishing insights on some of the problems of modern society, he makes
                            no claim to be an apologist for Christianity, which implies the
                            marshalling of logic and philosophy in defense of the faith. Instead, he
                            is a personal advocate for Christianity, a defense attorney who combines
                            attention to the facts with personal flair in attempting to sway the
                            jury on behalf of his client.</para>

                        <d:para>This is an example of a journalist who takes a magazine article and
                            stretches it into a book. This book, which chronicles the crash of a
                            commuter airline in Alabama, however, is not without some merit. His
                            short, almost minute, by minute chapters covering the nine minutes, 29
                            seconds between takeoff and impact is very gripping. The stories of the
                            individuals struggling to escape the burning wreckage is compelling. But
                            the book really loses focus as he attempts to follow the survivors as
                            they deal with the aftermath. This story probably would be better as a
                            TV special than as a book.</d:para>

                            ever read. It is one of those books that is hard to put down and yet you
                            wish would never end. It is just an absolutely fascinating look at the
                            bike racing season leading up Lance Armstrong's 6th Tour De France
                            victory. Lance Armstrong is fascinating because he combines almost
                            unbelievable athletic talent with an almost indomitable will to maximize
                            that talent. Of course, the miraculous recovery from cancer for added
                            spice. As if that weren't interesting enough, he has the capability of
                            inspiring incredible loyalty and unbridled hostility - often in the same
                            individuals. And of course, some of his competitors are equally
                            fascinating - particularly Jan Ulrich. Mr. Coyle combines the passion of
                            cycling enthusiast with a good journalist's objectivity and an excellent
                            writing style. If you are in any way interested in cycling, read this

                            outside of Mr. Armstrong's inner circle. Mr. Armstrong ranks as one of
                            the great frauds in sports history. As compelling this book remains as a
                            work of history, life is too short to recommend that anyone else spend
                            their time in the company of a fraud.</d:para>

                            Fourth Crusade, which is noteworthy (and controversial) for the fact
                            that it ended in the capture and sack of the capital of the Eastern
                            Church instead of the liberation of the Holy Land from the infidel. In
                            today's day and age, of course, all of the Crusades are controversial
                            given the fact that Islamic terrorists never tire of condemning the
                            results. Of course this view ignores the fact that the spread of Islam

                    <d:para>What I call "superlative subtitles" - (How such-and-such changed the
                        world forever). I believe that a subtitle only exists to offer clarity
                        whenever an author chooses to use a catchy phrase that may not convey the
                        desired meaning to the average reader. Instead, many books use the sub-title
                        for self-aggrandizement. Perhaps the worst example of this is <emphasis
                            xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="underline">April 1865: The
                            Month That Saved America</emphasis> (Some months are born for greatness,
                        some months have greatness thrust upon them .) An example of how a sub-title
                        should be used come from the monograph <emphasis
                            xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="underline">Double Canister
                            at 10 Yards: Federal Artillery and the Repulse of Picket’s
                            Charge</emphasis>. The author piques the reader's interest with an
                        interesting title, and offers clarity on the focus of his work. The trend
                        today rather would be to have the subtitle "The Unknown Artillery Officer
                        Who Saved America." The reason I dislike this practice so much is that is
                        assumes that the reader won't be able to figure out for themselves the
                        relative significance of the material.</d:para>

                        story. I can understand the complaint that a story that begins at the
                        beginning and continues straight through can be unoriginal. Yet the approach
                        of opening a book with the most gripping period in his / her subject's
                        history has been done so many times that it can no longer be considered
                        unique. This is perhaps attributable to a journalistic approach to history.
                        A journalist has to provide enough of the story to educate those who will
                        read only the first page yet try to grab the reader (or viewer's) attention
                        quickly in the hopes they will stick around for the whole story. For example
                        the journalist Evan Thomas employees this very technique in <emphasis

                            Jones</emphasis>. For alternatives, consider Niccolo Capponi's <emphasis
                            xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="underline">Victory of the
                            West</emphasis>, in which the author devotes two pages to examining the
                        actions of a few important, yet peripheral figures at the moment of the
                        battle. This gives the reader a brief taste of the excitement attendant with
                        the battle before the author plows through the necessary background history.
                        Or better yet, consider Victor Davis Hanson's <emphasis
                            xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" role="underline">A War Like No
                            Other</emphasis> in which he eschews a chronological retelling of the

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">I'm not sure whether Kristin
                            Lavransdatter is a trilogy or whether it is simply published in three
                            parts, but I will treat this as a set of three novels as it may take
                            awhile to finish the whole set. This novel is set in medieval Norway,
                            which is about as arcane a setting that you can conceive of in our
                            current world. The medieval world gets short shrift as it is in our
                            popular culture, and what little knowledge we do have seeming centers on
                            France, Britain and the Crusades. Our images of Scandinavia are either
                            of the bloodthirsty Vikings or the pacific, liberal and Lutheran (if not
                            outright agnostic) Scandinavians of the present day. However, this novel
                            is a very vivid depiction of life of the family in the lower orders of
                            nobility - in particular in the struggles individuals face in
                            reconciling the pull of romantic love with the duty to family, to church
                            and to the perceptions of society. As in <emphasis role="underline">The
                                Brothers Karamazov</emphasis>, the romantic involvement of the main
                            character creates conflict with her family and community and this
                            conflict is what drives the first volume. The stage is set for the next
                            volume with Kristin's marriage to her paramour. The author excels in her
                            vivid depictions of daily life and does a good job in developing
                            interesting and believable characters. The dialog is stilted with the
                            excessive use of arcane English, but this may be the translator's
                            fault.</para>

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">It is appropriately ironic that
                            I finished this book detailing the history of crimes against humanity
                            perpetrated by Communist governments and movements on May 1st. When I
                            was young and communism still reigned in Eastern Europe, May Day always
                            brought news clips of Communist soldiers goose-stepping their way across
                            Red Square in Moscow. This book was written by a number of left-wing
                            French academics trying to come to grips with what went wrong with a
                            movement that had been viewed so favorably by the left leaning academia
                            in the West. While totalling up the damage inflicted by communism, this
                            book suffers from a number of faults. First, it is poorly written,
                            particularly the chapters on communism in Latin America and Africa.
                            Second, because the authors are left-leaning, the suffer the lingering
                            effect of Marx and focus on material causes for the many wrong turns
                            taken under the banner of communism. Their moral outrage seems to stem
                            from the fact that the very movement they so long admired was, in
                            actuality no different than the Nazi / Fascist regimes they have so
                            detested. Certainly, the realization that totalitarianism is detestable,
                            and ultimately inhuman, is a critical revelation. But they are left in
                            the end to compare the Communists with their remaining "bugaboo", namely
                            the Church. For a much better treatment of the moral failings that
                            underpinned Communism (and ultimately led to its demise), read
                            Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag Archipelago.</para>

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Stacy gave this book to me for
                            Christmas. I listened to a recorded version of this book last fall and
                            was anxious to see how it compared to read it myself. Even on second
                            exposure, this remains a tremendously funny and moving novel. It is so
                            well written, that I expect to continue reading excerpts from the book
                            for years to come. In some ways, Mr. Helprin's writing is luxurious and
                            opulent - for example he can devote a long paragraph describing the
                            movement of water switching focus to the main characters on the bow of a
                            barge plowing through the Mississippi River. Yet he can also be
                            devastatingly funny with one line zingers, such as when the Cherry Hill
                            Police SWAT team makes their ignominious entry into a bank. One thing
                            particularly interesting about this book is his treatment of two figures
                            who are so familiar (Prince Charles and Princess Diana being the models
                            for Freddy and Frederika.) At the beginning of the book, Mr. Helprin is
                            savagely satirical, yet he leaves the characters basic humanity intact
                            so that the reader retains some sympathy. By the end of the book, the
                            characters have grown to almost mythical goodness, yet the author keeps
                            them grounded (and the reader amused) with continued satire. In the end,
                            the reader is inspired by the possibility that true nobility of
                            character can be obtained, yet left with the recognition that in
                            comparison, our present society is often a sad joke. At the end of the
                            recorded version of the book, there is an interesting interview with Mr.
                            Helprin by the actor who read the book. Mr. Helprin stated that his goal
                            in writing this book was to write a "romance" but not a romance in the
                            modern sense. He wanted to write a romance in the Medieval sense in
                            which reality and the supernatural are blended seamlessly to convey the
                            author's sense of what is true.</para>

                            Inspired Paul to Rant" Complaint #1: The subtitle. How can a month do
                            anything other than exist? When March faded into oblivion at midnight of
                            March 31, 1865, did April leap off the calendar, rush to the sound of
                            the guns and lead the charge to end the Civil War? No, I suppose the
                            author meant "April 1865: The Month in Which America Was Saved." This
                            would have been a more precise use of English, although it would not
                            have spared my criticism of the use of journalistic, superlative
                            subtitles. Complaint #2, the author had a magazine article's worth of
                            insight into a key moment of American history, and attempted to stretch
                            his material into a book through the use of unoriginal back stories
                            highlighting the various figures involved. Complaint #3 The author is
                            highly enamored of lists. The most humorous example of this was when the
                            author described Lee's arrival at Amelia Courthouse to discover that his
                            supply train contained not rations but ammunition. Perhaps in an attempt
                            to dramatize the moment, the author provided a brief list of what
                            actually arrived on the train followed by a much longer list of what was
                            NOT on the train. Instead of dramatizing the situation or offering
                            insight to what Lee and his soldiers must have felt at that moment, one
                            is instead left with the feeling that the author is being paid by the
                            word and is padding his account. (Of course, I wish I had thought of
                            that technique on a few instances in which I was attempting to meet an
                            instructor's length requirement on a research paper!). Complaint #4 -
                            lack of attention to detail by the author and editor. The most egregious
                            example of this is in his description of John Wilkes Booth's flight from
                            Washington DC after assassinating President Lincoln. After Booth crossed
                            the bridge over the Anacostia River, Mr. Winick states that he rode "for
                            the Mason-Dixon line." The Mason-Dixon line, of course, is the northern
                            and eastern border of Maryland, and Booth rode south by south east into
                            Charles County MD. Mr. Winick also mistakenly identifies Simon Cameron
                            as Attorney General (he was Secretary of War) and identifies Salmon
                            Chase as Secretary of the Treasury at the time when he had become the
                            Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Complaint #5 I listened to a
                            recording of this book, read by the author. He compounds poor writing
                            with a nearly monotone vocal delivery of the material. The book is not
                            entirely without merit, as the author does a creditable job of
                            illustrating the fact that the actual outcome of events in April 1865,
                            by all odds, should not have ended as well as they did. In some sense,
                            Mr. Winick is correct in identifying this as the moment when the United
                            States transitioned from a country of separate states into a single
                            nation. But he could have communicated that in less than 20
                            pages.</para>

                            autobiography, so this covers his early career and ends well short of
                            his role in the American Revolution. Even so, by this point in his life
                            Franklin had already had an extraordinary career. This book illustrates
                            Franklin's curiosity and pragmatism and is a good reflection on the
                            optimism of the Enlightenment period. Franklin's writing is engaging and
                            almost conversational, as if a lecture by a particularly charismatic
                            professor has been transcribed. But because Franklin never completed
                            this work (and it was patched together after his death), the biography
                            suffers from a lack of focus and structure. Even so, this book offers a

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para>Nathan Bedford Forrest is perhaps the most politically incorrect
                            figure in American history. A slave trader before the war, a master of
                            hit and run warfare, responsible for the massacre at Fort Pillow and the
                            head of the Ku Klux Klan after the war, Forrest has always been
                            surrounded by controversy. For this reason, he has served as a useful
                            symbol (both positive and negative) for abolitionists, racists and
                            African Americans. This biography does a nice job of attempting to strip
                            away the propaganda and portray the man in an unbiased manner. Forrest
                            was a man of extraordinary drive and determination, but he had a temper
                            to match. His temper appears to have been his Achilles heel, but this
                            biographer points out that Forrest had many redeeming features. For
                            instance, he recognized that the Ku Klux Klan had out-lived its purpose
                            of advancing the interests of Confederates dis-enfranchised after the
                            war, and indeed had become a tool of those advocating racial warfare.
                            This appears to have offended Forrest's sense of honor and by his death,
                            he was an outspoken (if not particularly effective) advocate for
                            reconciliation between Democrats and Republicans, blacks and whites. The
                            book is not particularly well written in terms of style, and it does not
                            always flow well. Yet the biographer does an admirable job of presenting
                            facts and exploring alternative explanations for his motives and
                            actions.</d:para>

                        <d:para>John Williamson Nevin is my great, great, great, great uncle. I came
                            across a book review in the magazine First Things. My interest in this
                            book is in the family history, and not in the history of the
                            Presbyterian and German Reformed Churches. But it is interesting that
                            "uncle" Nevin's viewpoints on the Church, sacraments and liturgy where
                            at such odds with the prevailing Protestant viewpoint of his day that he
                            nearly converted to Catholicism. The book is well written and the author
                            gives a balanced appraisal of the man, his career and his

                        <d:para>Monseigneur Vaghi, my parish priest, wrote a chapter in this book.
                            It is a collection of essays by Catholic priests on the importance of
                            Mary in the contemporary Church and in the past history of the Church.
                            This was interesting because I have never fully understood the devotion
                            that many in the Church have for Mary. But she certainly has to be
                            considered the greatest of saints, the one human being chosen to bear
                            the divine child Christ, the first disciple and apostle and the origin
                            of the earthly Church. Protestants charge that some have raised devotion
                            to Mary to worship of a deity, but this book emphasizes that purpose of
                            the adoration of Mary, as of all the saints, is to lead us to a deeper
                            understanding of Christ.</d:para>

                            the Democratic Party (then the more conservative of the two parties),
                            and certain characters are given greater emphasis (such as Colonel
                            Edward Cross). This book, however, offers nothing to justify a complete
                            retelling of the history of the Army of the Potomac and is much less
                            style than Mr. Catton's effort. This author relies almost exclusively on
                            other historians when providing analysis of major events. All in all,
                            not worth the effort.</d:para>

                            me. This book is a cynical examination of the neurosis of rabid sports
                            fans. I would describe it as a "stand-up" comedy routine in written
                            form. As a coherent treatment of its subject, the book is poorly
                            organized. It reads more like a collection of magazine essays. The
                            author is skilled at presenting absurd situations and mocking treatments
                            of those who take sports far too seriously. His numerous zingers often

                        <d:para>This is a reasonably well written history of the development of the
                            English language. The author has a readable style and provides many
                            examples in sidebars to illustrate his points. This book does illustrate
                            one of the problems with Social "Sciences" - i.e. disciplines in the
                            Humanities that aspire to apply the scientific method. The author's
                            biography states that he is a "linguist". I don't know if linguists
                            aspire to label their discipline as "scientific", but he certainly makes
                            use of scientific methods, such as statistical analysis of word usage in
                            old documents. And, like a scientist, he starts with a hypothesis that
                            there has never been a truly "Standard" version of English. But unlike
                            the true purpose of the scientific method, he does not approve of a
                            Standard version of English, but instead prefers the current move
                            towards more colloquial versions. And this is where "Social" scientists
                            get into trouble. Instead of using scientific methods to determine
                            cause, they use them to advance personal preferences. Mr. Crystal can
                            demonstrate that "Standard English" has always been more an ideal than a
                            reality, but he cannot demonstrate why it is better to not even strive
                            for adherence to a Standard. The closest he comes is when he states that
                            the self-esteem of those who do not (or cannot) speak the "Standard" is
                            adversely affected, but he offers no proof that this is true.</d:para>

                        <d:para>This is an outstanding military history of the Peloponnesian War.
                            Professor Hanson does not provide a chronological re-telling of events;
                            rather he recognizes that Thucydides has written the definitive account
                            of the actual events, and that many other authors have given their own
                            accounts from a modern perspective. What Professor Hanson does, instead
                            is to examine how the war was fought from an individual, tactical and
                            strategic perspective and thus seeks to explain why the war ended as it
                            did. Nor is he content to take Thucydides at face value. For example,
                            Thucydides writes that the Spartans marched into Attica and ravaged the
                            farms while the Athenians withdrew behind the city walls. Professor
                            Hanson then explains how difficult it is to actually destroy olive
                            trees, grape vines and green wheat, calculates how few Spartan soldiers
                            were available for the task of destroying the huge number of farms in a
                            very short time period, and concludes that probably very little physical
                            harm was done. But he also examines the psychological and emotional
                            effects on the Athenian citizens as they passively let the Spartans have
                            their way. Another positive feature of Professor Hanson's writing, even
                            though he eschews a chronological examination of the war and focuses
                            instead on illustrating various components of the war (plague, fire,
                            siege, armor, ships, etc.), someone with scant knowledge of the war
                            (i.e. me) has no trouble understanding what has transpired and why. My
                            only complaint is a quibble, and that is the use of contemporary
                            expressions to describe ancient viewpoints. For example, he calls the
                            oligarchies of Sparta and Thebes "right-wing", and at one point even
                            describes the Spartans domination of the helots as "apartheid." While
                            these terms are familiar to laymen in the present day, there are really
                            more differences than similarities between current "right-wing"
                            viewpoints and "apartheid" and the viewpoints of the Spartan ruling
                            class. This is the one time in which Professor Hanson betrays his
                            academic background, for in modern academia, these are terms of moral
                            opprobrium. He would have been better served sticking to the term
                            oligarchs / oligarchies and explaining in detail what these terms mean.
                            He is more accurate with the Athenians version of democracy, for he
                            explains how it is different from modern democracy. And while he uses
                            right-wing to describe the Spartans, he uses the more accurate and less
                            loaded term "radical" to describe the Athenian democratic viewpoint. But
                            again, this is a quibble, as this book is equal to the best military
                            history I have read.</d:para>

                            Charles Frazier is a gifted writer and story-teller. What I like best
                            about his writing is that he is able to portray life in 19th century
                            America in vivid detail. As with <emphasis role="underline">Cold
                                Mountain</emphasis>, this was a book that was hard to put down. It
                            is the story of Will Cooper, an orphaned white boy who is adopted by a
                            Cherokee chief and who finds a way to save a portion of the Cherokee
                            tribe from exile to Oklahoma. Despite Mr. Frazier's protestations to the
                            contrary, this work is based on the life of William Thomas. I was not
                            familiar with Will Thomas until we visited North Carolina this summer,
                            but it is clear from the details learned at the Cherokee Indian Museum
                            that his life serves as the framework around which Mr. Frazier weaves
                            his story. </para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">With all of the skill with which
                            Mr. Frazier writes, what prevents this book from greatness is a cynical,
                            modern viewpoint that taints a character from a decidedly pre-modern
                            era. Will Cooper is in many ways a romantic figure, and when I use the
                            term romantic, I mean in the sense of being part of the "Romantic"
                            movement of the 19th century. Cooper is a devotee of Byron's Don Juan
                            and Goethe's Tales of Young Wuerther, the love of his life is an
                            unobtainable woman. When his quest for the unobtainable ends, his search
                            for the one woman truly meant for him leads him to woo and bed many
                            woman who never seem to be just right. My first complaint, then of this
                            work (which is my complaint against the whole Romantic period), is the
                            love story between Will and Claire is elevated to a breathless,
                            super-heated level that bears no more connection to reality than given
                            by a Hollywood romance. Will Thomas' life seems incredible to us today,
                            but no more so than his near contemporaries Andrew Jackson or Davy
                            Crockett. They lived large lives in terms of what they accomplished, yet
                            their domestic lives were notable for their tranquility. So while I
                            respect Mr. Frazier's right to cast his hero in a Romantic mold, and
                            while this is consistent with the time period in which he lives, I think
                            he gets this wrong. I think his almost anti-heroic portrayal of his
                            accomplishment along with an over the top portrayal of his love life
                            does not ring true to life. </para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">But I must confess to not
                            knowing the details of Will Thomas' life in great detail, so my first
                            criticism may not be valid. My second complaint about this work is that
                            Mr. Frazier alternates between wild Romanticism and a decidedly cynical
                            modern view of history. This causes many inconsistencies in his story.
                            For example, Will Cooper keeps a journal for nearly his whole life, yet
                            when the time comes to detail his duel with Featherstone, he begs off
                            giving a definitive account of the duel with a comment about who can
                            really know what happens. This is a very modern viewpoint, that we
                            cannot ever know the truth about anything, that all reality is shaded by
                            the self interest of those viewing or reporting an event. Then there is
                            his cynical treatment of preachers, which even extends to Cherokee
                            medicine men / women. It would seem that anyone who offers spiritual
                            counsel to others is simply doing so to further their own ends. So we
                            get another modern viewpoint that faith is whatever an individual
                            decides it should be - in other words,  "moral relativism" rears its
                            ugly head. A cynical portrayal of government is consistent with the
                            viewpoints of Indians who have been sorely used and by someone who
                            fought on the losing side in the Civil War, but Mr. Frazier's targeting
                            of the Supreme Court as corrupt (which happens on two occasions in the
                            book) is curious. The Cherokee were active in using the court system to
                            avoid deportation and the Supreme Court even ruled in their favor, only
                            for Andrew Jackson ignore their ruling. I think here again, a modern
                            view of an activist court is being thrown back to an era in which the
                            role of the Supreme Court was much less than it is at the present. I am
                            put off by the modern cynicism that deprecates the worldly
                            accomplishments of man as simple indulgence of self interest, yet
                            celebrates an obsessive, yet celebrates carnal love as the highest good. </para>
                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> In conclusion, I think I will
                            re-tell a tale presented in <emphasis role="underline">13
                                Moons</emphasis>, the tale of the Spear Finger. This was an old
                            woman of the Cherokee tribe whose goes bad, her skin grows heard and
                            scaly and her finger becomes sharp as a spear. She uses her spear to
                            kill and eat other humans. As she roams the country, she sings songs
                            that sound incredibly beautiful, but which describe in gruesome detail
                            how she eats the livers of her prey. In the case of this novel,  the
                            song of the Spearfinger is an apt analogy for the beautiful writing that
                            beguiles, but ultimately destroys the object of the song. As I've
                            already stated, I believe that Mr. Frazier has done a disservice to his
                            subject. Whatever his romantic failings of Will Thomas (he never
                            married), they have rightly been forgotten. He was, however, able to
                            save the homes and way of life for a small part of the Cherokee nation -
                            something pitifully rare in the history of the American Indians. For
                            that he is still remembered and honored in western North
                            Carolina.</para>

                        <d:para>Stacy gave this to me last year as a birthday present. John McCain
                            gives profiles of people he admires. This book appears to be aimed at a
                            younger audience, and a cynic would say that the people profiled were
                            chosen for politically correctness. There may be something to this, as
                            Senator McCain released this book in advance of his run for President.
                            But a more charitable view would be that this is an attempt of an "elder
                            statesman" to contribute to the moral education of those who read the
                            book.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Really more of a novella - the story of a junior enlisted soldier in
                            Hawaii immediately after Pearl Harbor. Aims to be a morality tale about
                            how people cling to material possessions for protection in times of
                            danger. While I am left with the impression that the main character is
                            somewhat of an autobiographical creation, I find the plot to be trite

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para>Well written biography of John Paul Jones. This is a nice
                            introduction to the man, but is not particularly insightful. While Jones
                            was by all accounts a difficult man to deal with, too much is made in
                            this book of his short-comings. Jones had to deal with a Congress that
                            did not understand Naval affairs, with petty jealousies with other naval
                            officers regarding rank, with the most powerful Navy on earth as a foe,
                            and with crews that were more interested in prize money than national
                            interest and a revolutionary spirit fostered by the War for independence
                            that was sometimes at odds with the requirements of naval discipline.
                            Yes, Jones struggled with all of these issues, sometimes unsuccessfully.
                            Yet all the captains in the Continental Navy faced the same challenges,
                            yet only Capts. John Barry and Joshua Barney could match Jone's skill
                            and aggressiveness, and no one matched the scale of Jone's
                            accomplishments. Another issue, at least for those interested in
                            applying lessons from Jone's life to current Naval leadership, is the
                            author's focus on Jones' personal life and interactions with Congress
                            and later with the royal courts of France and Russia. Mr. Evans is a
                            reporter based in Washington with an interest in naval history, and
                            perhaps this explains his emphasis. As many modern historians are
                            inclined, he ultimately passes judgement on Jones' character and
                            accomplishment from the viewpoint of a modern "insider". He pays some
                            attention to technical skills required of mariner in the age of sail,
                            but offers little attention to the leadership skills required of a
                            captain. So, his final summation of Jones' is somewhat disjointed - not
                            a very nice guy, but one who tried to live up to the ideals of the
                            Enlightenment; a courageous fighter but a hard man to work with; a man
                            who in some ways was ahead of his time. In comparison, a much better
                            example of a biography is provided by Nathaniel Philbrik. Charles Wilkes
                            was a driven man with many personal shortcomings. But Mr. Philbrick's
                            account makes an excellent primer on leadership at sea on board a
                            warship that could be used in a classroom at Annapolis. He presents
                            virtues and faults in an even-handed manner, has a better understanding
                            of life at sea in the age of sail and analyzes what was accomplished
                            without passing judgement on the object of his biography. He certainly
                            presents the judgements others made of Wilkes as well as Wilkes' own
                            self assessments and leaves the reader to make up his own mind.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Stacy gave this book to me for my birthday. A very interesting
                            examination of the Battle of Lepanto, covering the events leading up to
                            the battle, the battle itself and its after-effects. It is no easy task
                            to summarize the events preceding the battle. In spite of the Ottoman
                            threat, Europe was badly divided, and it is something of a miracle that
                            a coalition between the Venetians and Spanish could be pulled together.
                            The immediate necessity for this coalition was the Ottoman invasion of
                            Cyprus. In hindsight, it is somewhat surprising the more unified
                            Ottomans were unable to fully take advantage of the divisions in Europe.
                            The Ottomans had become seemingly invincible on the Mediterranean Sea.
                            Despite the divisions among the Europeans, they still retained some
                            advantages - mainly in better application of technology. The Venetians
                            had modified transport ships to serve as floating gun platforms. These
                            ships were placed in front of the Christian formation and served to
                            inflict tremendous damage to the Ottoman galleys. They were able to
                            break up the Ottoman formations which prevented a coordinated attack.
                            The long term effect of the battle was to stem (but not stop) the
                            Ottoman advances at sea, much as the defense of Vienna blunted (but did
                            not stop) their advances in Eastern Europe. More importantly, this
                            battle illustrates a growing disparity in the development and
                            application of technology between the West and the Muslim world. This
                            book is well written, and the author does an admirable job of weaving
                            the stories of many different figures into a compelling story.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Stacy gave this book to me for my birthday. As I began to develop an
                            interest in current events in the very late 1970's and early 1980's, the
                            public figures I most admired were President Reagan, Prime Minister
                            Margaret Thatcher and Pope John Paul II. Despite the bruising criticism
                            delivered against these three by those in the liberal-leaning press and
                            academia, I found the vision of what was possible for society offered by
                            these three to be credible and inspiring. Of course, as I made my way
                            through college, much of the lustre seemed to have worn off Reagan's
                            legacy due to the problems in Lebanon and the Iran Contra scandal. But
                            Reagan's reputation was largely restored and vindicated by the public
                            outpouring of appreciation at Reagan's funeral and Mr. O'Sullivan's book
                            is a stirring reminder of how much these three figures accomplished.
                            This book mostly focuses on the roles each of these figure played in the
                            ending of the Cold War and the fall of Communism. Lesser attention (but
                            equal praise) is given to the economic reforms of Reagan and Thatcher
                            and the reinvigoration of Catholic orthodoxy by Pope John Paul II. The
                            book is not a scholarly treatment, but is a refreshing examination of
                            the 1980's from a conservative perspective. It is reasonably well
                            written, although it is somewhat broken up in the matter of long
                            magazine article (but perhaps this is to be expected as the author is a
                            journalist by trade). In any event, I really enjoyed this book.</d:para>

                        <d:para>We inherited this book from Stacy's dad, on the recommendation of
                            Tom (who had originally given the book to his father.) The first two
                            thirds of this book are an informative history of the development of the
                            modern American economy in general and the Federal Reserve in
                            particular. He does a good job of describing the development of two
                            modern economic outlooks - the John Maynard Keyes vision of direct
                            government action in managing economic activity via increases /
                            decreases in government spending and the Monetarist view of Milton
                            Friedman in which the Federal Reserve manages the economy via control
                            over money supply. He does a good job of outlining the theory behind
                            each approach, as well as the weakness of each approach. He also expands
                            the scope of his work outside the normal confines of economics,
                            examining what he feels is a conflict between capitalism and democracy.
                            Capitalism seeks the movement of capital to its most efficient and
                            effective use while democracy asserts that each individual is equally
                            important. And this is perhaps the core of his complaint of the Federal
                            Reserve. On one hand, it is too powerful, effectively controlling growth
                            of the economy while not responding directly to the public good. On the
                            other hand, it is not powerful enough, still vulnerable to pressure from
                            Wall Street and to the White House. Yet, for all his research, there are
                            some glaring problems with Mr. Greider's work. He brings psychology into
                            play in an attempt to explain human reactions to money and the behavior
                            of bureaucracies, yet his analysis is little more than the application
                            of "pop" psychology. While this may have some bearing on individuals, it
                            extremely unconvincing when applied to institutions. (In fact, I have
                            read articles about researchers who look into how humans deal with
                            figures and how groups of people respond in a market environment which
                            are quite interesting and much more pertinent the Mr. Greider's
                            analysis.) He almost completely ignores the role of commodities in the
                            economy, other than to state the high commodity prices are caused by
                            tight money policy. This contrasts to Jim Rodgers' contention that
                            rising / falling commodity prices are driven by supply and demand. Mr.
                            Greider recognizes that the American economy is shifting from
                            manufacturing to services, but can only see this as a bad thing. He
                            completely misses the dawn of the technical revolution that exploded in
                            the 1980's and 1990's, and bemoans declining worker productivity when in
                            fact the very opposite occurred. Mr. Greider appears to think that we
                            were on the verge of the next great depression in the 1980's. When
                            talking about the large budget deficits in the 1980's, he never once
                            mentions the Cold War. These problems make the last third of the book a
                            more difficult read. In fact, the book pretty much becomes a polemic
                            against the Fed and the Reagan presidency. Where early in the book, he
                            presents both Keynesian and Monetarist sides of view, by the end he
                            reveals himself to be an unabashed Keynesian who longs for greater, not
                            less government control of the economy. And as a result, many of his
                            predictions are, from the perspective of 2007, grossly inaccurate. But
                            this raises an interesting point about economics. It is easy to look
                            backwards and create a theory that explains the performance of an
                            economy. It is very difficult to take that theory and explain what is
                            happening in the economy at the current moment and seemingly impossible
                            to predict what will happen in the future.</d:para>

                            from my sister. I have only one real complaint with Mr. Burleigh, so I
                            will get it out of the way right upfront. His writing style is
                            occasionally awkward and generally quite dense. There are some sentences
                            so convoluted that you are left to wonder if an editor even bothered to
                            check his work. Also, he sometimes tosses out major ideas in an almost
                            off-hand manner. Given the amazing scope of his research, however, this
                            is more excusable. Mr. Burleigh has attempted a sweeping review of the
                            relations between Church and State in the West since the French
                            revolution. This is the first of two volumes and covers the period from
                            the French revolution to WW I. Thus, he covers a broad range of history
                            across many different nations while considering an impressive number of
                            sources. In so doing, he challenges the current academic assumption in
                            the West that religion has been purged from public life. If the
                            conventional view is that government is best off without religion, Mr.
                            Burleigh's examination of the process by which the Church and State
                            became separated shows that the early modern states adopted many of the
                            functions of a Church in an effort to supplant the religious church.
                            From the French republics' attempt to create a civic religion, to rise
                            of the non-conformist churches that challenged the Church of England in
                            both the religious and social realm, to the Kulterkamph of Bismarck in
                            the shaping of a united Germany, early modern European states fought to
                            diminish the Churches role first in government and then in society. But
                            where the church was forcibly ejected, the state proved to be sorely
                            lacking as a moral and spiritual exemplar. At the same time, some
                            churches lost confidence and conflated religious and moral principals
                            with political objectives (i.e. promoting socialism as morally superior
                            to capitalism). While the separation of Church and state was violent and
                            bloody in France during the revolution, the rest of Mr. Burleigh's
                            history provides the background for what will come in the 20th
                            Century.</para>

                            from Stacy. Sacred Causes picks up with the aftermath of WWI. Perhaps
                            because he has previously written about the Third Reich, Mr. Burleigh's
                            writing flows more smoothly, although he can't seem to help awkward
                            sentence construction. This book is a chronicle of all the bad things
                            that can happen when a totalitarian regime, in its hostility to
                            religion, sets up the state as a de-facto church. He also debunks
                            several left-wing beliefs, most especially a detailed examination of the
                            Catholic Churches opposition to the Nazis and Soviets. By the end of the
                            book, he takes aim at the results of increasing secularization of
                            Western society, including a scathing examination of the conflict in
                            Northern Ireland. I read this book in tandem with the Solzhenitsyn

                            Stacy. A compendium of writing by Solzhenitsyn which includes poetry,
                            short stories, essays and excerpts from his novels and the Gulag
                            Archipelago. His non-fiction writings offer powerfully argued, and
                            uncompromising criticisms (which are not confined to the Soviet Union.)
                            In his fiction, Solzhenitsyn is a masterful story teller. The overriding
                            theme in his writing is the individual's struggle for truth in the face
                            of an oppressive regime. Yet in the Gulag Archipelago and in his
                            fiction, his moral inquiry is matched by a keen interest in how
                            individuals respond to crisis. Rather than creating one-dimensional
                            straw men that he can easily demolish, Solzhenitsyn's characters are a
                            complex mixture of good and bad and are thus very believable.</para>

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">An interesting examination of
                            what "love" means to a Christian. This is particularly important for an
                            English-speaking society, that has only one word for all the various
                            aspects of love. He begins by contrasting "selfish" love with "giving"
                            love. He then examines in detail friendship, Eros and Agape (Caritas).
                            Mr. Lewis argues that appreciation for true friendship has almost been
                            lost in modern society. As an illustration, he points to the fact that
                            many moderns look at friendship in the past and view them as evidence
                            for the potential of a homosexual relationship. (For an example, Ron
                            Chernow in his biography of Alexander Hamilton, when discussing the
                            close friendship developed between Hamilton, Laurens and Lafayette,
                            cannot help speculating whether their closeness was the result of
                            homosexual attraction.) Mr. Lewis' discussion of Eros is equally
                            balanced as the modern meaning relates almost wholly to sexuality rather
                            than to romantic love in general. Unfortunately, I have written this
                            review a bit too long after completing the book to remember the full
                            details of his discussion on Agape / Caritas. To sum up the main point
                            of this book is that the dynamics of "need" love versus "gift" love, in
                            interaction with the various types of love, serve to draw man closer to
                            God. But when any aspect of love is over-emphasized, it can become a
                            "demon" in which the individual's attachment to love for its own sake
                            drives them from God and from their neighbors. This would be a good book
                            to buy to re-read.</para>

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">This was a very interesting
                            biography of George Washington. I was somewhat critical of Mr. Ellis for
                            his book <emphasis role="underline">Founding Brothers</emphasis> as it
                            felt as if it were slapped together. But as this is the third of Mr.
                            Ellis' books that I have read (also <emphasis role="underline">American
                                Sphinx</emphasis>), I realize that his style is not to provide a
                            chronological life story, but to use a the chronology of events as a
                            framework to delve into particular episodes that he feels are
                            particularly important. And sometimes this is particularly illuminating.
                            For example, Mr. Ellis devotes a fair amount of attention to the time
                            Washington spent in charge of the Virginia militia defending the
                            Shenandoah Valley during the French and Indian War. Most biographers
                            focus on Washington's experiences at Ft. Necessity and Braddock's
                            massacre at the start of the war and then his participation in Forbes'
                            expedition which captured Ft. Duchesne near the end of the war and gloss
                            over the time in between. Yet Mr. Ellis does an admirable job of showing
                            how the long, difficult and unglorious experience of defending a long
                            frontier against Indian raids gave Washington invaluable experience as a
                            commander, experience far more valuable than his time serving on the
                            staff of Braddock and Forbes. Mr. Ellis also does an admirable job of
                            avoiding one of my pet peeves - playing psychologist. Discussing the
                            aftermath of the capture of New York, he writes "Washington's army and
                            life were spared, because General Howe also behaved inexplicably.
                            Perhaps because he saw himself primarily as a peace negotiator instead
                            of a general, or perhaps for reasons only fathomable by psychiatrists,
                            Howe did not close the trap ..." Of course, the purpose of a biographer
                            is to explore what motivates their subject to choose particular courses
                            of action (or inaction). Mr. Ellis does a good job of speculation on
                            various possible motivations, both from his own point of view and from
                            the point of view of Washington's contemporaries. One final note, as I
                            read this book, I was also listening to Ron Chernow's biography of
                            Alexander Hamilton on CD. According to Chernow's biography, Hamilton
                            was, in effect, Washington's Chief-of-Staff during the revolution and
                            co-executive during Washington’s presidency. Mr. Ellis presents Hamilton
                            as just one of many talented junior officers that Washington employed on
                            his staff in the Continental Army, and describes how Washington utilized
                            the talents of Hamilton, Jefferson and Knox (and even James Madison).
                            Mr. Ellis' account, I must say, is the more convincing.</para>

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Stephen Brumbaugh, a co-worker
                            at Fannie Mae, lent this book to me. Mr. Schama takes very level-headed,
                            common sense approach to recounting the events of the French Revolution.
                            If he has one central theme to emphasize, it is that while the
                            Revolution was a radical political disruption, there was a great deal of
                            continuity in French society from the 'Ancient Regime' through the
                            Revolution, then the Empire and into the post-Napoleonic monarchy. And
                            the farther you get from Paris, the greater this true. For example, the
                            transition of the Aristocracy from feudal fief-holder to capitalist land
                            owner had been going on for some time before the Revolution. And the
                            Revolution, instead of destroying the aristocracy, only succeeded in
                            speeding this transition. He also shows that the Revolution was far from
                            inevitable, and that at a number of points, wiser moves by certain
                            people could have prevented the bloody anarchy to which the Revolution
                            finally descended. This even-handed presentation will set Mr. Schama, I
                            am sure, against the majority of contemporary academia - particularly
                            those inclined to Marxist interpretations of economic and class forces
                            at play in history. As one of the pivotal moments of history, the French
                            Revolution has been viewed and interpreted through the lens of many who
                            think they have discovered the means to understand forces which drive
                            human society. When Mr. Schama presents his interpretation of events he
                            also presents the viewpoints of others. On a personal level, I had never
                            obtained an in-depth knowledge of the French Revolution. It is
                            impossible to avoid the Revolution in any study of Western history, but
                            it is usually presented in the following way: the Bastille is stormed,
                            Louis is beheaded, the Reign of Terror, Napoleon comes to power. To give
                            some perspective to this compressed summary, these events were played
                            out through both of Washington's terms as President and most of Adam's
                            term as well. Also, when viewed against the American Revolution, it is
                            hard not to think about why things progressed so well in America and so
                            badly in France. There are many similarities and many differences
                            between the two revolutions, but it is hard to argue against the
                            simplistic view that leading figures in America simply had more "common
                            sense" (and more good luck) than those who tried to create the new
                            France. Also, I am much more familiar with the Russian revolution in
                            1917-1918, and it is amazing how many parallels there are between these
                            two revolutions. France and Russia both had aristocracies that were in
                            the process of transitioning from a feudal political and social
                            arrangement to a modern, capitalist system. Each aristocracy was largely
                            sold on the idea of "progress", yet reluctant to being pushed to
                            relinquishing all of the ancient trappings of power. And each
                            aristocracy was not willing or able to use force to preserve their
                            position in power (a compunction which their opponents did not
                            share.)</para>

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">I read this book the summer
                            before my senior year in high school; I decided to read it again after
                            listing to a book on tape about the sinking of the whale ship Essex.
                            Herman Melville's blends a great sea yarn with reflections on the
                            natural history of whales, the history, customs and economy of the whale
                            industry and general philosophical reflections. The plot doesn't follow
                            the modern trend of milking as much tension as possible before reaching
                            a resolution. Instead, the reflections that are interwoven throughout
                            the plot serve to delay the final resolution. It was much more
                            interesting reading this the second time around as I approached the book
                            with much more patience. Some criticize this book as being too long (and
                            too boring) because of the biological, historical and philosophical
                            diversions, but this criticism can only come from impatience. After all,
                            real life does not proceed from crisis to crisis prior to a final
                            resolution, but instead offers periods of action interspersed with
                            periods of calm in which one has time to ponder and reflect on what has
                            happened and what will happen. If I do have any criticism, it is in some
                            of the "Romantic" viewpoints that seep into the philosophic musings of
                            the narrator. There is a bit of the "noble savage" viewpoint when
                            contrasting simple but admirable natives (especially the three
                            harpooners) with the more civilized but conflicted officers that doesn't
                            ring quite true. After all, in this story, the harpooners had left their
                            "simpler" cultures for the mercenary life style of a whaler, and for all
                            of their virtue, they were active and willing participants (as were all
                            the crew save Starbuck) in Ahab's demonic quest. For me, the most
                            interesting characters are Ahab and his officers, for it is their
                            actions and interactions that drive the tension and make the final
                            resolution believable. Another reason why I enjoyed this more the second
                            time around is that I understood much more of the nautical and religious
                            symbols used in the story. I would like to read a well annotated version

                            Stacy's father. It is hard to finalize a grade for this collection of
                            essays. In terms of influence, this ranks as one of the most important
                            collection of essays in American history. In terms of style, the
                            language is often difficult to follow without close attention,
                            (particularly with Hamilton's essays). Also, from our perspective after
                            more than 200 years of (mostly) successful government, most of the
                            arguments in favor of the Constitution and of representative democracy
                            seem self-evident. Having started this at the same time I was reading
                            the history of the French Revolution, I was most struck by the plain,
                            common-sense reasoning that went into creating and then promoting the
                            Constitution. Rather than the wild-eyed idealists in France who
                            all-to-frequently substituted violence for logic, the Founding Fathers
                            attempted a thorough examination of the pros and cons of all the forms
                            of government in history, contrasted these conclusions against the forms
                            of government then in existence and while weighing the merits of the
                            existing state constitutions. The arguments in the Federalist Papers
                            build on this analysis and display an equal measure of mistrust both of
                            those who hold power and those who put them there.</para>

                            It also contrasts this true freedom with the illusion of freedom that

                        <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">I can't remember where I read a
                            recommendation for the work of Mr. Kirk, but as a consequence I checked
                            this out from the library. This is a tremendous examination of the
                            sources that produced American society. Mr. Kirk first defines what
                            order is and what it means to a society, and then outlines the
                            contributions of four "cities" to the development of the American order
                            - Jerusalem, Athens, Rome and London. He then describes the prophets and
                            philosophers and saints and rulers who shaped first the English and then
                            the American order. He weaves his own commentary with extended quotes
                            from the sources he highlights and the result is impressive. Having read
                            about the French Revolution and then the Federalist papers, this book
                            makes it clear why the American "Revolution" succeeded and why the
                            French Revolution descended into chaos. The Americans did not overthrow
                            the existing order, only sought to maintain the order that had developed
                            in the colonies against British attempts to modify the political and
                            economic handling of its colonies. The French sought to throw out the
                            old order entirely without realizing that a nations order is something
                            that is developed organically and cannot be created and imposed without
                            despotism. (Mr. Kirk even hints that the French "order" had been
                            irreparably damaged when Louis XIII / Louis XIV and Cardinal Richelieu
                            created the absolute monarchy that was destroyed in the Revolution.)
                            Someone who had checked out this book before me had highlighted large
                            tracks of this book, and indeed, I found myself wanting to record many
                            insightful passages. But because this is a fairly long book and I needed
                            to finish it to return it to the library, I had to rush through.
                            Stylistically, this is written in a very accessible manner (as opposed
                            to Burleigh) and this book was a pleasure to read in addition to being
                            instructive. One stylistic quibble, Mr. Kirk does have a tendency to

                            Msgr Vaghi when Little Flower had a book sale as a fund raiser. This is
                            the autobiography of St. Therese. Her writing is very simple, almost
                            childlike and yet very engaging. She tells the story of her upbringing,
                            her desire to serve with her sisters as a nun and the discovery of her
                            "little way" of serving God through love. What is particularly
                            refreshing in our age of sensationalism is how the seemingly
                            common-place is transformed into something extraordinary through an
                            almost childlike desire to please God the Father. St. Therese is a
                            living exemplar of Christ's injunction: "Whosoever shall not receive the
                            kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein."</para>

            <d:para>The following quote gives a very good description of what a rating of 5 means for a
            book. "Best of all were those winter evenings when I crawled into bed and grinned a big
            grin as I picked up our lovely hardcover edition of Kenneth Grahme's "The Wind in the
            Willows", with illustrations by Michael Hague. Before I cracked it open I knew I would
            like it, but I never really expected to be transported, as, evening by evening, I was.
            After the first night (I read only one chapter at a stretch), I wanted the experience to
            last as long as I could possibly drag it out. It was with a sigh compounded of pleasure
            and regret, and satisfaction in Toad's successful homecoming that I closed the book. I
            knew I would read the "Wind in the Willows" many times, but I could never again read it
            for the first time." (Alan Jacobs, "Beyond the Wild Wood.") This feeling is very close
            to what I felt in reading, among others, <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"

                        <d:para>Audio book. Given the current tumult in the financial world, this is
                            a very fascinating autobiography by one who has had a tremendous impact
                            on America's current economic system. Mr. Greenspan had an interesting
                            childhood and early adulthood, and developed a very thorough interest in
                            economic statistics and a keen desire to understand how human behavior
                            contributes to, or is influenced by, the "numbers." His curiosity is
                            matched by a very even handed appreciation of the strengths and
                            weaknesses of anyone who attempts to shape economic policy. I consider
                            that his lack of ideological ax to grind is a major intellectual
                            strength, but then again his advocacy for a libertarian, free-market
                            economy could be considered an ideology. If he does have a short-coming,
                            it is an unquestioning appreciation of the ideals of the Enlightenment
                            and a corresponding faith that truth can be arrived at from the data. So
                            while he can analyze and understand the forces that are driving China's
                            current economic growth, he is almost dispassionate in his evaluation of
                            the human costs involved. Stylistically, he very effectively spends the
                            first half of the book chronicling his life and career and the second
                            half of the book dealing with the development of the world economy
                            during his career in much greater depth. It will be interesting to see
                            if he writes a follow on book in a few years to analyze the causes of
                            the current recession.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Stacy gave this book to me for Christmas. Jim Stavridis has been a
                            frequent contributor to Shipmate, the USNA Alumni magazine. He was
                            captain of the USS Barry at the same time I was in the Navy, and this
                            book is his personal journal from his time in command. The Barry is an
                            east coast destroyer and was part of the USS George Washington
                            battle-group, so he covered some of the same water ways that I did when
                            HS 3 deployed to the USS Theodore Roosevelt, although at different
                            times. For example, the Barry made a port of call in Guantanamo Bay
                            (about 6 months after I had been stationed there for Haitian refugee
                            relief operations. He mentions the Officers Club and the Navy Exchange,
                            both of which were frequent hangouts during my stay. He also mentions a
                            Jamaican restaurant that I had eaten at, although he apparently missed
                            the excellent Jamaican seafood restaurant that was located next door to
                            the "O" Club. The Barry patrolled the water off of Haiti a year before
                            HS-3 participated in Operation Restore Democracy (i.e. a threatened
                            invasion which forced the current dictator to flee), although I spent
                            this period onshore at Guantanamo Bay, not far from Haiti. The Barry
                            patrolled the Adriatic the year after the Roosevelt did its Med cruise,
                            and like the Roosevelt, the Barry made a high speed transit to the Suez
                            canal in response to the crisis-of-the-day in Iraq. So, this book
                            brought back many memories for me, although my perspective as a young
                            supply officer was far different than that of a ship captain. ADM
                            Stavridis is an engaging writer, and his enthusiasm for the Navy is
                            apparent. I think it would have been very beneficial for me to have read
                            this as a midshipman - it would have been a tonic to the usual cynicism
                            that many feigned when I was at Annapolis. From the perspective of a mid
                            of my day, he would seem "gungy" (short for Gung Ho) in his enthusiasm
                            for the Navy and perhaps a "smack" (i.e. a kiss-up) for the pleasure he
                            takes in building relationships with those up (and down) his chain of
                            command. But with the benefit of hindsight, these are qualities, when
                            genuine rather than feigned, that contribute to success in any field.

                        <d:para>Audio book. Typical of John Keegan's best work, well researched and
                            thought provoking. Mr. Keegan's argument is that no matter how capable a
                            nation's intelligence gathering community, war is still decided by the
                            application of force and will on the battle field. He presents a number
                            of case studies, the most compelling of which occur in WWII. First, he
                            illustrates how the British, with numerically superior forces and
                            knowledge of the exact date and most of the order of battle for the
                            German invasion of Crete, still managed to lose the island. For most of
                            the first day of the battle, the British slaughtered the German
                            paratroopers. But the British suffered from poor tactical communication,
                            and the defenders of one airfield pulled back pre-maturely. This gave
                            the Germans enough of a toe-hold to fly in sufficient reinforcements to
                            turn the tide. The other example is the battle of Midway, which is
                            justly famous for the advantage the Americans took of foreknowledge due
                            the breaking of Japan's naval code. Despite knowing exactly where and
                            when the Japanese were going to strike, the 5 of 6 American squadrons
                            were shot to pieces attacking the Japanese fleet and the 6th found the
                            Japanese at the end of their range and at the exact moment the Japanese
                            fighter cover had been drawn out of position. Mr. Keegan makes a fairly
                            convincing argument that intelligence is given too much importance, at
                            least by the lay person, as a contributor to victory.</d:para>

                            The journalist appears to have framed his questions so that the Holy

                            questions aren't very profound and the book is somewhat choppy. There
                            are, however, some particularly interesting responses - particularly
                            those on human dignity and the defense of the unborn and on what really

                        <d:para>A collection of short stories by Flannery O'Connor. Generally, I'm
                            not a huge short story fan. I have never understood why short stories
                            were so popular. For instance, Mark Helprin is one of my favorite
                            writers, but I have read most of his short stories and find them mostly
                            forgettable. Anyway, these are pretty heavy stories. As I mentioned last
                            in reviewing Wise Blood, her writing has the atmosphere of Faulkner but
                            with a stronger moral purpose. Few of her characters are sympathetic,
                            and almost all of them serve in one way or another to illustrate how
                            disordered life is without God. </d:para>

                        <d:para>Evan Thomas is a capable writer and this book is a fast read.
                            However, while Mr. Thomas spins a great yarn of the Battle of Leyte
                            Gulf, his analysis of the events and the actors involved is weak. For
                            starters, he chooses to follow 4 characters as their paths converge at
                            Leyte Gulf, trying to compare and contrast the different personalities.
                            Instead of adding much depth, this tends to chop the flow of the
                            narration. And while I was delighted that he focused on the life and
                            career of CDR. Earnest Evans (for reasons I will explain in a bit) the
                            focus on two Japanese admirals and Admiral Halsey make this an odd fit.
                            Most of the focus is actually on Admiral William "Bull" Halsey and
                            follows the common criticism of Halsey's actions at Leyte Gulf -
                            specifically his decision to leave the San Berandino Straight unattended
                            while he pursued the Japanese carrier force. Given the severe drubbing
                            the Japanese absorbed, Mr. Thomas implies that Leyte Gulf was a deeply
                            flawed victory - indeed you would almost think it was a major defeat
                            given the level of hand wringing over the results. Despite the
                            conventional wisdom that Halsey was overaggressive, I'm not entirely
                            convinced. The Japanese plan for the attack on Leyte was deeply flawed -
                            they divided their already weak forces and attacked piecemeal. And they
                            were soundly defeated in detail. And even if the Japanese had completed
                            the destruction of Task Force Taffy3, I don't think it is conclusive
                            that they could have gotten past task force Taffy 2, then Taffy1 and
                            then Adm Oldendorf's battleships to reach the transport fleet supporting
                            MacArthur's invasion. I think the real issue was the poor communication
                            between the 3rd and 7th fleets and between Nimitz and MacArthur. Mr.
                            Thomas lays the casualties of Taffy3 at Halsey's feet, but he does not
                            consider that casualties may not have been any lighter had Halsey met
                            Kurita with the full force of the 3rd Fleet. These are interesting
                            points to ponder, but are apparently beyond Mr. Thomas. He, like many
                            modern journalists, is more interested in debunking myths than in
                            understanding the truth. But even a cynical journalist can do nothing to
                            debunk the heroism of Commander Evans and the crew of the USS Johnston.
                            CDR Evans won the Medal of Honor for unequaled initiative and bravery by
                            launching an unsupported torpedo attack on the Japanese battleship group
                            and continuing the fight until the bitter end.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Stacy's brother Tom Kalaris gave this book to me from his father's
                            collection. Since it was a diary, I had little interest in reading it.
                            However, it received a glowing recommendation in a recent edition of
                            First Things, so I decided to give it a try. Although I have found that
                            diaries usually make for a disjointed, episodic telling of events, Mr.
                            Colville is a wonderful writer with a very keen eye for character. Of
                            course, it helps when you are the personal secretary to Churchill,
                            certainly one of the most interesting characters of the 20th Century.
                            Where this book really shines is in giving you a feel for how great
                            events seem to slowly play out, day-by-day. Most histories cover the
                            events of 1939 - 1940 as a rapid fire string of crisis upon crisis. Yet
                            what seems inevitable in hindsight is shrouded in doubt, uncertainty and
                            confusion in real time.</d:para>

                        <d:para>My father gave this book to me. The story of a Polish cavalry
                            officer who was arrested by the Soviets following the fall of Poland in
                            1939. He was sentenced to 25 years and shipped to a camp in Siberia. He
                            escaped with 6 other prisoners, who walked from Siberia to India. Along
                            the way, they picked up a young Polish girl who was escaping from a
                            collective. The girl and one of the escapees died in the Gobi desert,
                            and two more men died in the Himalayas. I checked up on Mr. Rawicz on
                            the Internet, and there is some doubt about the veracity of his story.
                            The BBC claims that Soviet records show Mr. Rawicz being released to
                            Iran in 1942. Personally, I would find the Soviet records suspect, as
                            the first version of this book was written in the 1950s. The Soviets
                            would naturally with to discredit this book. All the same, this is a
                            very stirring story..</d:para>

                            years of the mid 1980's. Mr. Lewis is quite witty and his style reminds
                            me very much of P.J. O'Rourke. This book is particularly informative on
                            the origins of the mortgage-backed securities industry. I wish I had
                            read this 10 years ago when I was starting out at Fannie Mae as there is
                            nice insight into why MBS and REMICs became attractive to

                        <d:para>This is a fascinating book. Perhaps on first blush not on the same
                            level as <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
                                role="underline">The Brothers Karamazov</emphasis> or <emphasis

                                Punishment</emphasis>, but there is still much to ponder. Lets start
                            with the title. In English, an idiot is a fool, a person whose lack of
                            common sense brings trouble down upon their own head. And when I studied
                            in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and was socializing with my Russian
                            friends, I uncharitably referred to a fellow naval officer as an idiot
                            (in Russian) for engaging in some rather immature behavior). I remember
                            the odd looks this comment elicited. For in Russian, at least in the
                            context of this novel, an idiot is more of someone who is mentally
                            handicapped. Retarded may be a more exact English translation. So Prince
                            Myshkin, the so-called idiot, is similar in some respects to Pat
                            Conroy's character Forrest Gump (although I am only familiar with this
                            character from the movie, not from the novel.)</d:para>

                        <d:para>In some ways, this is one of my favorite C.S. Lewis books. He brings
                            his curiosity and persistent intellect to bear on understanding the
                            psalms on a personal level and then using an effective conversational
                            style to convey his observations to the reader. This is not a psalm by
                            psalm analysis of the content of each psalm, but an examination of
                            themes that are either troubling to Christians or of particular interest
                            and benefit. He does a great job of trying to understand what the psalms
                            meant to the Jews and then to the early Christians, and then speculates
                            on how there meanings are applicable in the modern world. I found this
                            particularly helpful, because each Mass includes responsorial selections
                            from a particular psalm, but sermons almost solely focus on the gospel
                            reading. This book also is an effective manual for approaching the
                            selected psalms in a contemplative manner.</d:para>

                        <d:para>In some ways, this year has been the "year of Peter Kreeft" -
                            beginning with the Modern Masters CD course "Faith and Reason" , then on
                            to the "Handbook of Christian Apologetics" (still in progress), as well
                            as audio lectures downloaded from his website. I was impressed enough
                            with these two works to purchase "Before I Go", a collection of short
                            reflections that Professor Kreeft has written as a legacy for his
                            children. Prof. Kreeft has a gift for explaining concepts in philosophy
                            and theology in a style accessible to laymen - in fact, he is the
                            professor that every undergraduate should have had for an introduction
                            to philosophy. Prof. Kreeft is also an unapologetically "orthodox"
                            Catholic. This book, does not delve deeply into matters of philosophy or
                            theology, but instead offers a summary of all the important lessons that
                            he would like to pass on to his children. While I do have some minor
                            issues with his style, this can be excused as he is writing to a very
                            specific audience, his family. And the short observations sometimes seem
                            too pithy, as if they were written for a self-help column in a popular
                            magazine. But despite the often cute presentation, each observation
                            points to truths taught by the Church (Catholic and Orthodox). And I can
                            say that I do not think he has missed the mark on any of his
                            observations, and I would recommend this book to my own children (but
                            not until they are in high school.).</d:para>

                        <d:para>Stylistically, this is a textbook, but it written in a manner
                            accessible to laymen rather than to graduate students. The authors
                            present the arguments both for and against religion in general and
                            Christianity in particular. In fact, one of the strengths of this book
                            is that it takes the arguments of unbelievers very seriously. Rather
                            than setting up straw-men that they can easily demolish, they honestly
                            attempt to understand the reasons for dis-belief and then to try to
                            answer the reasons. I intend to return to this book again, next time
                            paying more attention to the discussion items at the end of the

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para>Anyone familiar with American Colonial history is likely familiar to
                            references to Pilgrim's Progress. It seems, however, that very few
                            people today have actually read this allegory. The language is dated but
                            still very accessible and the personification of the various virtues and
                            vices that a Christian pilgrim encounters on the way to heaven are often
                            quite entertaining. Indeed, the "Vanity Fair" is a very familiar term,
                            and although I don't know if Bunyan was the original creator of the
                            "Vanity Fair", its negative connotation makes one wonder at why anyone
                            would adopt this as the title of a magazine. As befits a classic of
                            Protestant literature, the parable is well salted with appropriate
                            Biblical versus. And also in keeping with Protestantism is the emphasis
                            on the personal struggle for salvation. For this reason, I find the
                            second half of Pilgrim's progress to be more interesting as Christian's
                            wife and children are escorted along the same pilgrim's path with the
                            assistance of a strong guide. This is much closer to the Catholic view
                            in which the Church serves as the pilgrim's guide.</d:para>

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para>Mr. Morgan has eschewed a retelling of colonial history focusing on
                            the great men and great events of those fascinating times. This has its
                            good and bad points. On the positive side, he presents the stories of
                            many fascinating individuals who get no mention in most history books.
                            Particularly interesting are his account of the Pennsylvania "Walking
                            Purchase" in which the Delaware Indians agreed to a purchase of an
                            amount of land in which one man could walk in a single day. The colonial
                            land speculators hired a number of young men to run as far and as fast
                            as possible. Also very interesting are his accounts of the settlement of
                            the Carolinas and the work of surveying the original Northwest
                            Territories. To the negative is a rather jaundiced eye to the "big
                            names" of colonial history. William Penn in particular is dismissed as a
                            hypocrite. This is unfortunate because Mr. Morgan is by and large very
                            balanced in examining the strengths and weaknesses of all the parties
                            involved (settlers, Indians and slaves.) Also, his focus on the settlers
                            leaves a very broad-ended scope, and their is no rhyme or reason for the
                            abrupt ending of the book in the early years of the 1800's.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Mr. Lewis' allegorical treatment of his intellectual development and
                            ultimate conversion to Christianity. It owes an obvious debt to Bunyan's
                            Pilgrim's Progress, but the personification of challenges to spiritual
                            growth are not the traditional vices but modern intellectual movements
                            (beginning pretty much with the Enlightenment.) I read a copy of the
                            third edition, which contains an nice review by Mr. Lewis of his own
                            work. His criticism of his own writing is as unsparing as was his
                            original criticism of those parodied in his book. Despite his own
                            critique, this was entertaining as well as intellectually stimulating.
                            Sometime theological apologetics is much more easily digested when
                            disguised as allegory.</d:para>

                        <d:para>I gave up relatively quickly on Mr. Horowitz's travelogue of his
                            attempt to follow in the path of Capt. James Cook's voyages. The book
                            starts out very well with a description of his week aboard the replica
                            of Cook's ship - The Endeavor. His description of a collection of land
                            lubbers whipped into shape as a crew upon a working cruise provides a
                            nice insight into live on an 18th century sailing ship. However,
                            subsequent coverage of his trip to Tahiti with his heavy drinking
                            English expatriate friend seems to offer more insight into late 20th,
                            early 21st century male middle-aged crisis than insight into the
                            remarkable career of Capt. Cook. Normally, I would assign a grade of 1
                            to a book I did not finish, but Mr. Horowitz deserves some credit for
                            his fine writing in the first chapter.</d:para>

                        <d:para>Did not finish. Uncle Steve moved to Australia this summer, and I
                            was able to pick through the collection of books he was leaving behind.
                            I was quite excited to find a book by Ivan Doig that I had not read. Mr.
                            Doig is a fine writer, although his novels tend to stick to family
                            conflict as a plot device. However his ability to vividly describe
                            landscape and character and a wonderful gift for narrative generally
                            make his works very enjoyable. This novel, however, was deeply
                            disappointing, and after 160 pages, I have given up. In addition to the
                            usual family conflict, the plot centers around the construction of the
                            Fort Peck Dam in Montana during the depression. There are two chief
                            problems with this novel - the family conflict is grossly overwrought -
                            too many characters with too many petty disputes. And to compound the
                            issue, the flow of the novel is far too choppy. Most scenes are broken
                            up into very small vignettes. While a good novelist (and Mr. Doig is
                            certainly a good novelist) can carry and intertwine multiple plot lines,
                            the effect in this novel is disjointed and choppy. And, ultimately, it
                            does not allow me to connect with any of the characters. </d:para>

                        <d:para>A collection of essays on some of the more controversial generals in

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para>An interesting subject presented rather blandly. This book was given
                            to Stacy's father by her brother Tom; Tom started his career at J.P.
                            Morgan. This is the second book by Mr. Chernow that I have read, or
                            listened to in the case of his biography of Alexander Hamilton. The book
                            really loses focus after the death of Jack Morgan when the author is
                            left following the pieces of the Morgan empire as they spin farther and
                            farther apart. For a historian who writes primarily about business
                            subjects, he never delves at all into the technical aspects of how
                            business is actually conducted. His focus on the personalities thus, I
                            suppose, give him grounds for passing moral judgement on his subjects
                            and he does so quite frequently. His seeming lack of interest in
                            technical details does not seem to stop him from judging his subject's
                            competence, but it does undermine any confidence in his opinion. If Mr.
                            Chernow were writing about Fannie Mae over the past several years, he
                            would be along the lines of a Washington Post business section writer -
                            lots of details about the CEO, the lobbying of Congress and a cursory
                            nod to the huge amounts of Fannie debt being purchased by foreign
                            governments. What I am more interested in is the Wall Street journal
                            view - all the same details provide by the Post writer, but with the
                            nitty-gritty of such items as duration measures, the growth and
                            composition of the portfolio, etc..</d:para>

                        <d:para>An account of the election of Pope Benedict XVI in 2005. Begins with
                            an overview of the death of Pope John Paul II, and an overview of his
                            papacy. The coverage of his death and funeral was particularly well
                            done. Reading his account of those days brings back a flood of personal
                            recollections of that time. Then moves on to coverage of the election of
                            Pope Benedict and then a brief biography of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger.
                            Concludes with a listing of the challenges and opportunities facing the
                            Catholic Church under Pope Benedict's guidance. In many ways, this book
                            seems to be an attempt to explain the Catholic perspective of the
                            "changing of the guard" within the Vatican from the orthodox Catholic
                            perspective. Mr. Weigel does a nice job of being objective in covering
                            the positive and the negative while emphasizing that the work of the
                            Holy Spirit was involved throughout the entire process. This is not the
                            account you would receive from the secular press, nor is it intended to
                            appeal solely to the believer. Overall, would not be exceptional if not
                            for the personal connections with the coverage of the funeral of a great

                        <d:para>I'm still not sure how to grade this story of two sailors surviving
                            66 days in a lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean. The author initially comes
                            across as self-indulgent and self-centered, and I'm not sure if I
                            completely believe his account of how his sailboat was rammed and sunk
                            by whales. And initially, I thought this was much less effective then
                            the account of survival in a raft presented in "The Raft". Also, I was
                            initially put off by the almost too personal accounts of the squabbles
                            with his wife and by his overly detailed description of the challenges
                            presented by bodily functions in a confined space. But as the book
                            progresses, I found that Mr. Butler's repetitive narration (after all,
                            every one of the 66 days seems to involve the same activities and
                            emotional states) provides a compelling account of the ups and downs of
                            two humans facing very long odds. But reviewing the grading criteria, I
                            will go with a 3.</d:para>

                        <d:para>This book is an overview of the history of the development of maps.
                            The word that best describes this book is "dry." There are some nice
                            parts - I have been fascinated by the Phoenicians since the 5th grade
                            when I had to write a report on the subject. Mr. Brown's treatment of
                            their skills in navigation would have been very useful to my research.
                            The chapter on the development of a means of determining longitude at
                            sea appears to have been lifted and somewhat expanded in the book
                            Longitude (which I listened to on tape a few years back.) Otherwise,
                            there is not a lot of interest, and there are not enough illustrations
                            to support the author's text.</d:para>

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para>This is the second time I have read this book. When I first read it,
                            about 15 years ago, I was somewhat disappointed. The writing, in Mr.
                            Helprin's inimitable style, was engaging but the plot was entirely
                            farcical. In a sense, the novel is a jeremiad against coffee and
                            investment banking. 15 years ago, when I was still in the Navy, I did
                            not drink coffee and knew nothing of the financial world, so much of the
                            humor did not strike home. But now I do drink coffee, I have worked in
                            the financial industry for the past 10 years and I have just read a
                            detailed history of J.P. Morgan and his progeny. I also now recognize
                            that this book is more an extended reflection upon what passes for
                            beautiful in this world versus what is truly beautiful. The plot may be
                            fantastic and the main character progresses from one farcical situation
                            to another (at times you wonder whether the story is "truthful" or
                            perhaps the delusions of an insane man), which is why I think I was
                            initially put off by this book. Characters in a farce have much less
                            depth than we come to expect from characters in a "realistic" novel. But
                            when the purpose of the novel is to contrast the what is beautiful with
                            what is mundane, the lack of depth of character is not as important. And
                            when the author is making the case that is true beauty is not that which
                            is most valued by modern society, then the jarring effect of farce is
                            actually quite effective. Mr. Helprin uses farce to even greater effect
                            in his next novel, Freddy and Fredericka, in which he is contrasting
                            what is "noble" with what is ignoble. Freddy and Fredericka, however
                            winds up being a superior novel because the characters start off as
                            silly, one dimensional props for slapstick humor, but wind up growing in
                            depth and character (and thus evoke more sympathy from the
                            reader.)</d:para>
                        <d:para>I think Mr. Helprin is a tremendously interesting author, not only
                            for his fine style and craftsmanship but also because he writes of the
                            world as he thinks it should be rather than as he finds it in reality.
                            He delights in the glories of God's creation and is not afraid to
                            imagine the world as if mankind had never been expelled from the Garden
                            of Eden. I have given a couple of his books to my Uncle Steve, but I
                            don't think he has enjoyed them much. Uncle Steve certainly enjoys fine
                            writing (Cormac McCarthy and Ivan Doig are two of his favorites and they
                            are among my favorite writers in terms of style), but I think he, like
                            perhaps most "modern" readers find it difficult to relate to Mr.
                            Helprin's lack of grounding in the everyday reality. But as I have aged,
                            gotten married, had children and grown in maturity, I increasingly am
                            put off by the modern tendencies towards strict adherence to practical
                            reality, to the avoidance of happy endings as "untruthful", to the
                            rejection of absolute standards of good and bad. In college, I enjoyed
                            Faulkner's <emphasis xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
                                role="underline">As I Lay Dying</emphasis>, which is also a farce,
                            only without the benefit of any redemption for the characters. It was
                            entertaining, sometimes funny and conformed to the sense that mankind'
                            sufferings constitute what is reality. Cormac McCarthy is a superb
                            writer, and his characters are gritty, tough and compelling, but there
                            are no happy endings. Authors now seem to be afraid of being labelled as
                            soft or sappy, and as a result, their art loses its power to inspire
                            wonder and awe and joy. Yes the world (or parts of it) can be horrific,
                            but it can also be beautiful. Mr. Helprin is not afraid to celebrate the
                            beauty.</d:para>

                        <d:para>A collection of essays and miscellaneous writings by Thomas Merton.
                            When writing about spiritual matters, he is very interesting.
                            Particularly good was the essay "Philosophy of Solitude." Also pretty
                            good were the essays "The Power and Meaning of Love" and "Christianity
                            and Totalitarianism". At his best, he creates vivid images of the power
                            of quietness, solitude and separation from worldly care. Sometimes, but
                            not often, this can go over the head of most of us who are not monks or
                            hermits. But overall, he is an eloquent spokesman for the
                            counter-cultural rejection of materialism. But in other essays, he can
                            occasionally come across as smug. His essay on Boris Pasternak tries too
                            much to sound like a review in an literature journal - to paraphrase,
                            "the wiser sort" will recognize Pasternak's artistic gifts. His essays
                            on art make valid points on the weakness of "modern" art, especially
                            religious art, but he offers little in the way of an
                            alternatives.</d:para>

                    <d:annotation>
                        <d:para>This is a fascinating novel. It takes awhile to get going, as Mr.
                            Pasternak introduces a number of characters of varying backgrounds. But
                            as the novel proceeds and the focus settles upon Zhivago and Lara, all
                            the loose threads are seamlessly interwoven. In Disputed Questions
                            (reviewed above), Thomas Merton mentions that some criticize this novel
                            for the multitude of remarkable coincidences that bring all the
                            characters into the story. Of course, this criticism misses the point,
                            and is indicative of a lack of imagination. After all, a novel should
                            use language to illustrate something important - say truth, or something
                            beautiful or inspiring. The contemporary insistence on "plausibility"
                            leave little room for beauty or inspiration and confuse facts with
                            truth.</d:para>
                        <d:para>In structure, this book is similar to the novels I've read by
                            Dostoevsky and Solzhenitsyn. All three of these novelists skillfully
                            manage to focus on a central figure and their interaction with a host of
                            other well developed characters. Nor are any of these authors in a rush
                            move the plot along. In tone, however, this novel differs from those of
                            Dostoevsky and Solzhenitsyn. Those two are almost deadly earnest. While
                            they may be humorous at times, they have adopted the mantle of author as
                            prophet or moral authority. Pasternak has written Dr. Zhivago in a much
                            lighter tone. The focus is not on holding the corrupt portions of
                            society in a harsh spotlight, but creating characters whose fullness and
                            sympathy make the Soviet society seem small and undeveloped in
                            contrast.</d:para>
